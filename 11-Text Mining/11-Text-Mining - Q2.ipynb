It is not nearly as loud and clear as similarly price phones.The screen is a bit small and the actual body of the phon doesn't seem as solid as I have come to expect from similar phones.I definitely think it's in the above average range based on the amount that you are paying.

       " 'I purchased this phone as replacement for my old phone (Xperia XA1, released in 2017, ~C$330), and used about 1 month.Display : Large, bright and beautiful. Though Xperia XA1 sometimes had touch issue (no response) around the display edge, this Pixel 4a does not have any touch issue so far.CPU : Fast and quick response. I have no stress during my use. I mainly use web browser, mail, maps, SNS apps, YouTube and so on (light apps only). I don\\'t play heavy apps like game on this smartphone. So I can\\'t say whether this phone is good for playing game or not. When I used Xperia XA1, displaying photo took several seconds. However, this Pixel 4a can show everything quickly.Storage : 128GB is large enough for me, difficult to use up all.Camera : Can take beautiful pictures. Video is also very good. \"Astrophotography mode\" can take photos of night skies. I used this function in Vancouver, BC, Canada (look at the photo I posted). ... Not bad for a smartphone camera. But I felt it is difficult to take a beautiful photo of the milky way as found on google image search. Maybe because light pollution in Vancouver is terrible.Battery life : Battery lasts long enough.Fingerprint reader : The sensitivity of the reader is good. The reader is placed on the rear of the phone. I don\\'t think this position is good. I sometimes mistakenly touched the sensor when I picked up my phone.Appearance : Mat black body looks nice.

       " 'El mejor teléfono en calidad precio del momento',\n",
       " \"This phone was purchased after extensive research and positive first hand experience with the Pixel 3a.  After several weeks of waiting for the new phone to ship after it was released, I am very pleased with the functionality of this new Pixel 4a.One of the biggest selling points for this phone is the price. I didn’t want to finance another $800 phone from Verizon so I opted for an unlocked phone that I could purchase and connect to their network. This phone was a bargain at $349, but there is nothing cheap about this phone except for the price.The Good: Besides winning on price, this phone was a breeze to set up. The SIM card easily inserted into the phone and it quickly connected to the Verizon network without issue. The set up instructions were easy to follow to get the phone up and running quickly. The Pixel 4a also transferred all data, apps, and pictures from my old Galaxy S7. It used a USB cable to connect and download everything. Even texts, voicemails, and everything else transferred over so I never felt lost. Google Chrome and Gmail are my primary browser and email so browsing history and saved passwords also transferred over.  Apps needed to be logged into again and there were some forgotten password issues, but nothing that couldn't be fixed.Once connected this phone operates smoothly and it is easy to navigate. It is a bit different than th 3a and other Android phone as there is no back button and everything is controlled through swipes.  It takes some getting used to but works smoothly once you get it down. The camera is outstanding and surpasses any phone previously used.  Another bonus with this phone is the battery life which ranks high on my list of important features. This battery lasts all day long even with regular use.  The battery on the 3a is great and the battery on the 4a is awesome!  It also charges very quickly with the provided charger and I estimate a full charge takes approximately one hour.The Bad: The bad really isn’t all that bad when taken in proper context. There is a reason this phone is half the price of other models since it’s missing some luxury features. Apparently this phone isn’t waterproof, which comes as a surprise to me since I’ve never known any phone to be waterproof and am always careful with my phones around water. Wireless charging capability is also missing from this phone so you may miss that feature if wireless charging is your thing.  It really isn't a big deal though since the battery lasts so long this phone is rarely on the charger anyway.This phone does take a USC-C cable so it isn't compatible with the cables from older Android and Kindle devices, which use Micro USB cables.  It comes with one USB-C cable but you may want to purchase another if you like extra ones around the house or in the car.  Again, not a huge deal because of the battery life.Summary: This is an outstanding phone and should work well for the vast majority of users. It operates and looks far more expensive than it really is, making me realize how much the phone companies are ripping us off selling overpriced phones. It wins in value, setup, camera, operating speed and battery life. Minor points are lost for missing some of the fancier features like wireless charging and being a different charging cable than most people already have, but those don’t weigh heavily on my opinion of this Google Pixel 4a so I am giving this a strong four stars.\",\n",
       " \"I bought this phone for its camera. I don't use it as a phone. The camera lived up to my expectations. But after 3 months I had problems. The fingerprint wouldn't work and I could not access the GooglePlayStore for more apps.After a chat with Google the chat person said to factory reset it. I did this reluctantly even after she told me all my data would be saved. IT WASNT so I lost it all and it didn't solve the print or playstore problems. Next day after 3 hours of more chat and futile tests with Google they agreed to send me a replacement if I send this one back. So I have and I hope the new one (may be refurbished..ugh!) will perform better. Overall it's a good device and the photos are excellent. Doesn't integrate well with my Apple Mac and iPod tho. But for its general ability its a good device. Don't know about how it is an actual phone.\",\n",

       " \"I was very excited about this phone. I read multiple glowing reviews. Phone arrived yesterday and I've spent several hours with it. I am coming from a 3-year old Samsung Galaxy S8. There's nothing really wrong with that phone. It's just not getting updates anymore and I liked the thought of a pure Android phone. The S8 had some quirks such as a big delay in being able to take a picture while Google Maps was active (bad for road trips).Here are some thoughts/findings about the 4a vs the S8:1. On the 4a I find it a bit frustrating to not being able to close apps as easily as on the S82. The S8 camera has more options - including a pro mode. I think it still takes marginally better pictures than the 4a3. The Gboard has a space and down button at the bottom which is impossible to remove. Gboard on S8 does not have this4. I find it very easy to hit the back button gesture by mistake on the the 4a and then have to open the app again5. I immediately installed a case and screen protector on the 4a, but it still feels like I could easily drop it6. The battery life isn't that great on the 4a - about the same as the 3 year old S8 I'd say7. Stereo speakers on the 4a is nice - but you have to hold it about a foot away from your face to get the effect8. 128 GB of included storage on the 4a is nice (vs 64 GB on the S8), but I also have a 200 GB SDCard in the S89. 4a gets hot! It has complained about not being able to do a few things (transcribe for example) because it was too hotJury is still out if it will replace the S8 or not. And if it does replace it, what happens to the old phone? It's only worth $100 or less.I'd say if you were looking for a great phone for the money, and it's better that what you currently have, definitely get the 4a as it's a good price and has a lot of great features. However, carefully compare it against what you currently have as it might not really be that much better.\",\n",
       " \"Though I've only had this Pixel 4a a few days, it has been great so far.  The phone came roughly 60% charged and, as far as I can see, didn't require any security updates right away. I was able to open the box and start set-up right away without waiting for charging. The instructions for set-up were good.  The box has the cord thingy so you can easily transfer everything from your old Pixel phone to the new one in about 15 minutes or less. It also included a little tool thingy to help get the SIM card out.  This was a nice and unexpected bonus that saved a lot of grief.  The transfer of everything from the old Pixel to the 4a was smooth and didn’t take a ton of time; the most frustrating part is having to remember your google password, and any other passwords for apps you had on the previous phone.  Also some settings needed to be readjusted.  As of now, I don't seem to have lost anything, though 8 of my contacts transferred without the names. To clarify: the numbers were there in recent texts without a name attached to them but I was able to read the previous texts and determine whose number it was so I could add them as a new contact by using the 3 little vertical dot thingys on each text. I loved my flagship Pixel but knew I needed a new one because the old one wasn't being supported anymore and performance was getting slower.  I chose the Pixel 4a largely due to the fact that the Pixels don't have all the bloatware that comes with Samsung and other brands. I don't use FB or Twitter or a lot of those other apps that take up space and not having these unneeded apps on my phone was a huge deal for me. I like having it be our choice whether to put an app on my phone rather than having these forced on us. I also like the Google Keep for notes and the Google Calendar since I had these on previous phones and everything transferred to this Pixel 4a smoothly. Another good factor is the price of the 4a (this was significant in our decision), particularly because it seems to have everything I need and not a bunch of stuff I don't need or want. An additional plus is the larger screen (no bezel) while still keeping the small size of the phone. The screen looks classy and it's small enough to not be a problem getting in and out of a pocket or purse.  Everything is faster and smoother than the old Pixel. The plastic hardware isn't a big deal to me because I use a solid wallet-case for my phones so protection is provided & people don't see the outside of the phone anyway. There are a few nice, new 'bells and whistles' to learn if you are going from an older Pixel but they are good things and nothing to cause great frustration so far. I'm still struggling a little with the gesture thingy - and how to double-tap to get recently used apps to come up so we can close them all out.  I liked the way we did it on the old Pixel better - but I am adjusting.  I’m also noticing that the new camera seems to be saving 2 of every cameral shot (supposedly one is for editing) and this is annoying because they take up extra space and we rarely edit our photos, so we have to delete the duplicate almost every time. I sure hope Google photos fixes this issue soon.  I’m hoping this review might help others who are considering an upgrade to the Pixel 4a.  Overall, the upgrade from the flagship Pixel (or Pixel One, or whatever they call it now) appears to have been a good move.\",\n",
       " \"It has been a long wait, as my old Pixel continued to deteriorate, but glad that I was able to upgrade to now my favorite Android phone. The Pixel 4a is amazing, the colors are a little bit different than my old Pixel, but I know I had the same situation when I was moving from my Nexus 5x. This phone is beautiful and with multiple applications open, it's fast and smooth. I'm using the eSim with T-Mobile and that works great. I have spent a couple hours using it and really no complains, it's light, but not flimsy and my Spigen Hybrid case doesn't add much to it.\",\n",

Battery life seemed great and the phone was snappy. But after the 2nd day I noticed the 4a would not stop rebooting and I could not figure it out as I was not running any new apps. After scratching my head and playing around with it, it seems to be a physical build quality issue where the battery power source is interrupted. See the video of me tapping the phone on my desk and it just turning off, repeatable every time. After I filmed this video the phone would not turn back on. I posted this issue to Reddit and someone else confirmed they had the exact same issue. There must be some major quality control issue.',\n",
       " \"No user manual, not in the box, not online.  It seems the only available information is on Google's Pixel Phone Help web page and on the phone itself.  Both assume I know enough about what I don't know to search for it.  According to one post, the rationale for limiting user information to online help is the rapid pace of change.  That's what versioning is for:  new release, new version of the manual.  It's no more difficult than updating online help.  Both formats are useful; each serves a different purpose.I may be wrong, but I suspect the company's refusal to produce a user manual is evidence of the disdain with which Google engineers view their user community.  The attitude is not uncommon among software developers.  I know whereof I speak; I am a software developer, though not for Google.And, yes, I returned the phone.\",\n",
       " 'You know the scam on the street when someone tries to direct you to a certain store to buy garbage items so that they can get a kickback? Yeah, it\\'s like that.  Was using the Honor 6x with Android 7. Was excited to get the updated system. Sorely disappointed!  What have done Google?!? So much bloatware on this. Everything has some ad you cannot get rid of (I\\'m looking at your Print store ad in G Photos here!) Terrible photo/file management. Very poor notification management. When I open my phone, I want to see MY stuff, not YOUR garbage! The app icon management leaves MUCH to be desired. Messaging? What a crowded bunch of \"enhanced\" options. That not enhanced, it is just useless clutter. Oh look, yet another notification for Call blocking while I write this! Yep, third one today and have the notifications turned off. Not from apps I have installed but from Android itself. Glad this has a long return option as I will continue to test it out but so far...the 3 year old phone from a much-maligned company has you BEAT! (and it was $100+ cheaper!)',\n",
       " 'Edit:  I traded this phone in at about the 18th month due to the lack of 5G.  I camp and T-Mobile\\'s 5G has incredible range and speed--something I discovered with the wife\\'s 4a 5G phone.  But for that I would have kept the phone the full 18 months.  At this point though the phone is worth less new due to only less than 18 months of remaining security updates.The last year or so has been a concern for me because I was afraid the mid-range phone I bought three years ago would break.  The new offerings have not been compelling, mainly offering better cameras but not significantly stronger processing and smaller manufacturing processes (e.g. 7nm).  That has changed just in the past few months and even days as there are now at least three compelling mid-range phones.  I bought the Pixel 4a because it was:  (1) One of the least expensive; (2) Offers one of the best OS upgrade/update policies; and (3) Is not made in China or by a Chinese firm--pick your reason not to like China right now--there are at least four.  There are things I wish it had, primarily microSD and a SD 765G processor, but the 730 is plenty fast. IMHO, we\\'re well past the stage where most people have any real need for flagship processors (gamers excluded) I\\'ll upgrade my wife\\'s phone to 5G later, we would mainly need that for tethering, and we don\\'t both need it.  It will probably be the 5G version of the Pixel 4a or the Samsung 51.The packaging is fairly basic, containing the phone, a 120 volt charging block, USB-C cable and a sim tool.  Also, it has a very useful adaptor from the large plug USB to USB-C.  That is given to help connect to your old phone, but is also useful for Yubi security keys.  The phone came roughly 60% charged and didn\\'t require any security updates that I noticed, having Android 10 installed with security updates current to within 15 days (which makes me think I missed a security update being installed).As to the phone, it\\'s roughly the same size as what I\\'m used to coming from a Moto 5G Plus, but it is slightly narrower.  Overall I like the change.  I have not noticed any lag, and overall the phone seems very responsive, as it should coming from a phone that is over three years old in design. I wasn\\'t sure I\\'d like the fingerprint scanner on the back, but that has been fine. Setting up was a bit more difficult in that the automatic transfer process the phone tries to start apparently did not work at all, or maybe I\\'m just not patient enough.  My old phone said \"preparing\" for over 20 minutes without any indication of progress on either phone.Setting up the old fashioned way was very quick, with my roughly 150 apps installing quickly.  The only problem I\\'ve had is related to my Google Suite Account, which in the newer version of Android becomes a work account.  That keeps me from signing into Google maps with that account, which I\\'m still trying to work around.  If you don\\'t have a paid Google Suite Account this shouldn\\'t be an issue.  I also had to change a few of the default settings, but surprisingly few.  I turned off a few things to save battery life, such as monitoring for songs in the background, and turned on the virtual navigation keys at the bottom of the screen, which I prefer to their gestures system.Too early to say anything about battery life because my use of the phone has been far from normal.  I\\'ll report back if it can\\'t get through a normal day with at least 25% of battery left.',\n",

       " \"An important smartphone release at a time when there seems to be a real shift away from flagship devices and a move toward mid range value propositions. And with the global economic challanges ahead, the release of the Pixel 4a could be a watershed moment.The form factor is ideal for me. Whilst I understand the benefits of larger screens, the tradeoffs are too big IMO. The 4a is just so easy to handle and carry and it is so light!The pure Android is a plus. I have had bloatware on my previous two devices (Huawei) so it is a welcome change. The option to 'pause' apps is great too.Battery is good. Easily a full day. I now have battery saver mode set to auto-enable at 75% and can get 1.5 days of moderate usage.I have not had a chance to use the camera much at all but can say that the colours are an improvement over my Huawei P30 and so is the video stabilization. The P30 has an excellent camera with some advantages over the 4a but I like the results from the 4a more.As an aside, the P30 was a form favourite of mine, the best smartphone I had owned. Ticked a lot of boxes including its compact for factor. It edges the 4a on performance (the 4a does suffer from occasional lags and stutters) and has a few extra features like face unlock and onscreen fingerprint reader. But the 4a has nudged in front of the P30, albeit only slightly.Anyway, I am sold on the 4a. It delivers in spades. I don't need wireless charging nor do I drop my phones in water. I don't need a 90+hz display (the 4a's OLED display is excellent BTW) nor do I need facial recognition. I like having the option of a headphone jack though and I like having extra money to spend on other things in life.I have purchased the Spigen Rugged Armour case which provides excellent protection.\",\n",

My callers get terribly pixelated videos of me that are so bad that they can't even see my face anymore. And other times it gets so blurry and visually noisy especially in low light settings, with a pixelated areas. I know it is not my internet speed because I've never experienced this before with my last pixel xl phone. I noticed this issue before the Android 11 update but it still continued afterwards. Nothing changes even after I restart. The phone is not even a day old. I'm not sure what to do now. I was so excited to finally receive the phone after waiting for so long, but this is unacceptable.\",\n",

The Pixel 4a is absolutely stunning for it's low price point. Double the storage than my last phone, a better camera, better screen, fantastic OS, updates for three years, free google photos storage.. and all for 50$ less than my previous phone!The camera is the selling point for me. It is just as good as the cameras on flagship phones, and it's only one camera. Google's software really seriously kicks ass.The touch screen is snappy and I don't find myself wishing it was faster, it responds immediately to touch, scrolls fast and looks vibrant.The screen to body ratio is perfect, really great job removing bezels.The hole punch is not at all irritating, I've had the phone about three weeks now and I am completely used to it. It blends in and works well with what is on the screen and there are plenty of wallpapers to suit it. It is much better than a notch of a bezel. It looks cool I think.The base storage being 128GBs is seriously nuts. My last phone I only got 64gbs, because in order to get the 128gb version it was $100 more! With 128gbs and free google storage, I can't imagine needing more space ever, really.I'm really enjoying the phone, it's nice to hold even with a case, it's lightweight and pleasant to view and type on. I don't imagine myself getting another phone for at least 5 years. It is an absolute powerhouse of a buy, highly recommend.\",\n",
       " \"I had the Pixel 3a XL prior to ordering this phone, but my wife needed a better phone, so I ordered this one and gave her my 3a XL as she wanted the larger size.My biggest concern was the screen size difference, but with the slim bezels on the 4a, the overall screen size is really not much different when compared to the 3a XL. You can see a slight difference when you hold them side to side, but in practical terms of use, its very neglible.As for the phone itself...I love it! It has the awesome camera I have come to love with the Pixel lineup, the fingerprint reader is still in place, it has more memory and RAM than the prior model and the size is much more manageable than the 3a XL was. While I do have very large hands, the smaller physical size of the phone is just much easier to handle, and much easier to operate one handed.Prior to my Pixel 3a XL, I had the Huawei Mate 10 Pro - which I absolutely loved. I have also had Nexus and Galaxy phones, as well as a few other more budget friendly phones.For the MONEY - this phone is an absolute slam dunk! Everything you need, nothing you don't.Full Transparency - I am not a gamer, so I can not attest to how it holds up in heavy gaming. But beyond that, it works wonderfully.If there is any downside, it is the battery. Not that it's small... I have gotten through all day on more than one occasion. However, with my slightly more than average use, I do find myself needing to top off late in the evening. The good news is that in as little as 15 mins, this thing will charge up 50% or more, so it's not a huge deal. If you are going to go out for the evening, just plug it up while you are getting ready, and you'll be more than good to go!They claim that the adaptive battery software will continue to optimize the phone's battery life over time, so we'll see how that goes. But despite that, it is still a phone I would recommend ALL DAY LONG, especially when comparing to other phones in this price point.Oh, and having just one color choice?? What does that really matter, especially when virtually all of us put some sort of case on the phone. There's a good variety of cases to add color, so don't let that stop you.\",\n",

Amazon won't issue me a refund without returning the phone. I'm not comfortable retuning the phone with my info and accounts open.I tried to explain this to several times to customer service and they told me to contact google.

I hope it will come back and start working again.

I find myself charging the 4a several times a day, whereas I rarely had to charge my 2XL once thought the day.Also, the camera. It is SO fuzzy with the front camera, and the rear camera honestly didn't blow me away. I'm a professional photographer, so I'm a bit snobby about the camera on my phone.Honestly the battery life for the 4a is just okay.

       " \"I'm not a fan of this phone.  Might return it, but what a hassle!It’s a good-looking and comfortable phone.  Battery lasts for about 4-5 days.  And it was much, much cheaper than other phones.  (hmmm, wonder why?)First and most importantly, it constantly tell me I have no signal.  I haven't moved, and have been with my carrier for many, many years, and this phone is the only phone that can't find the signal.  Constantly.  As in most of the time.Usage is not intuitive.  It does many other very annoying things, and I can’t figure out how to make it stop doing the very annoying things.  I went online for a user manual and the link sent me to a site to set up your new Pixel.  Um, already done – where’s the user manual?  There is no user manual – too bad, so sad.  Also, a search of google, ironically, reaps no results on how to make the very annoying things stop.  It is possible this phone is customizable, but you have to be a google master phone engineer to figure it out, and they’re sure as stuff not going to tell you.Bottom line for me was money.  Calls generally work ok, as does text.  But email?  Holy C, you'd think I was asking it to do something easy!  I have to slog through a full crap-load of automatic and unwanted questions (can’t answer the call without a question about contacts, can’t read a text without question about contacts, etc.) before I can do the common things.  I do wonder if google even knows you can do that later IF you want to at all?  So annoying!I also wish it had a home button as I'm forever accidentally calling people when swiping up which, as far as I have learned to date, appears to be the only way to get to the home screen and jumps right through contacts.  Also have to go to home screen if I send an email because it kicks me out.  If I want to read and respond to the next email, gotta start anew from the home screen.  Stupid.Would not buy this phone again, although I think google could easily fix the operating system.  I wonder if they ever will, though.  Doubt it.  Very disappointing.\",\n",
       " 'The two great things about the pixel are it\\'s price point and camera. Everything else including proper camera controls was forgotten.The main issue is the screen sensitivity, I have medium sized hands and fingers (size 9-10) and am quite adept at typing but I felt like I was losing my mind and motor skills trying not to fat finger this keyboard even at its tallest and least cluttered setting. I tried typing the same sentences on different devices and would have 4x the amount of errors on that keyboard. It does help to remove the glass screen protector but then you lose that layer of protection.Most of the new features and controls advertised are either novelties, poorly implemented, or downright dysfunctional. The gesture controls are chaotic. Basically making the entire edge of the screen a very sensitive swipe to go back which is more like the slightest touch will trigger it. Trying to scroll down through a long article... nope you triggered the back button and now you have to reload the page or app. Want to pass the phone to someone to show them a photo, nope either of you will likely trigger that back command and they\\'ll wonder what you were trying to show them.So I switched back to the old 3 button layout but wait.. they put a button for Live Transcription right next to the Square \"Overview\" button so there have been many occasions that I unknowingly triggered it and drained my battery transcribing a walk through the woods or me muttering to myself while editing or programming.I use a lot of Google Home devices and it is getting annoying to have to avoid using the world Google like your saying Voldemort in some Rowling novel or else you get cursed with the Assistant trying to search for or make a music selection based off of a snippet of your completely unrelated conversation.Finally that lovely little camera has the worst most non-intuitive controls I have ever used on a phone. Sure you can get some great astrophotography shots but you have to turn on Night Sight mode and hope that the camera detects stars or something to trigger the mode. Yes you can\\'t shoot astrophotography unless the phone thinks that is what you want. Try fighting phone controls in the late evening in 20 degree Yosemite park and you\\'ll wish you had a DSLR with actual buttons so you can keep your gloves on, touch screen gloves are thin and don\\'t work well due to aforementioned sensitivity issues. Switching between camera modes requires a swipe and then some have a popup so to go from Portrait mode to Slow-mo you have to carefully swipe over a couple icons and then touch one of the options that appears above video all with a very temperamental screen. It is not fun especially when your cat is being adorable and you miss shots.I also have a feeling this phone will be quickly unsupported by Google as they are already releasing things for the 5 and 5g models that aren\\'t available for this one. Then it seems like they are randomly and silently removing features as well.For now I am going back to my old phone (a very unsupported, cracked, and dull LG G6) and now being both burnt out from the new Pixel / Android mobiles and the IOS options, I may just relieve myself of the burden of carrying a smart phone and go for a simpler approach.',\n",

The fingerprint reader is just practically instant, and the placement on the back is the right place for it. I always hated the Samsung's button fingerprint reader, and it seemed like a crap-shoot whether it would work or not. this one is just darn solid.Camera is great, and the battery life is just unbelievable.Unless you -absolutely- need some of the missing features, like the wireless charging, wide-angle camera or the faster-refresh rate, then this is the one to get. If you do feel like you need those, do make sure you ask yourself if they are worth paying over 2x the cost of this phone for them...This isn't just a great phone for $350, it is a great phone full stop, and if this is the feature set and performance I can now expect at this price point, I will never shell out $1k+ for a phone ever again.I didn't get it through amazon as it was sold out, but I also got the google branded case and that one is also fantastic and highly recommended.

The battery life is at the top of the pack for Android phones and the camera takes BEAUTIFUL pictures. USB-C charging is fast and the phone works well with third-party chargers. I've had no issues pairing it with my car or headsets and transferring over all of my data from my previous phone was a snap.One *really* nice feature of this phone is that it is dual-SIM capable; you can have both a virtual and a physical SIM. If, like me, you carry a phone for work and a personal phone, you can consolidate down to one device and choose which carrier you use for your outgoing phone calls, and data, while being able to text and call from either number.If you are in the Android ecosystem, this is the phone to get.\",\n",
       " \"So I have had zero issues with the fingerprint reader. It is actually been really good for letting me in and nobody else in. I even put a case on mine and I can still reach the finger reader so I actually think it's really great it's much easier for me to get into my phone compared to my old one. What I like about this phone too is that it is thinner. I used to have the Moto x charge and that was definitely much wider and I didn't realize how much more uncomfortable it is. Now when I pick that one up to try and compare to this one it's such a beast in such a tank. Whereas this new phone it's thinner and slimmer and can actually like fit in my palm so it's in my hand and then it can sit nicely on my finger like if I'm holding it like cut. Which is very nice and I can reach everything on it with my thumb. The fact that the screen is the entire phone face is still giving me the exact same size as my old phone just I no longer have a big phone because it didn't take up the whole screen it had sides on it before so I really like that this one is the whole screen and that it's slimmer. I have a nice case on it and I have a screen protector on the front and I'm still able to use everything the same and everything is functioning fine. My only thing is yes the battery does last all day, my old phone my battery could last a couple days but it was an ex-charge and the battery was supposed to do that. But the bonus about this phone here is it does tell me if I keep continuing using it at the rate that I am it tells me about when my phone will die the estimated die time for the battery. So that's easy for me to be like oh okay well I'm going to be going and doing this so maybe I should charge it now. But I typically only charge it at night when I'm going to sleep. it does have a spam detection for calls which I didn't realize was a thing and I've had a couple phone calls like pop up but never ring and then they go away and I am notified that they were spam and then I have verified and they actually are indeed spam. So that has been really nice. I also like that I can give names to my group chats. Everything seems to be running very smoothly and fast at least faster than what I'm used to. it did take a little getting used to for me to do the back button cuz there was no back button I couldn't figure it out but if you just hold off to the side a little bit it is actually much easier to go back and forth between things I've found. my screen now has five icons across compared to my old one that had only four icons across so for me that's fine because I can see them fine I haven't looked to see if I can change that. So if you are maybe hard on seeing that might not be a benefit but otherwise for me since I don't have that problem this is great I really also like that I can just click on the time and date on the phone and it pulls up my calendar or the weather I don't have to go search for a different app I just click on it on my phone and it just takes me to that app.my other favorite thing is that it is still an Android phone I absolutely love the Android app I even have my tablets in Android because I'm just so used to Android and I prefer Android over the counterpart. Like I really dislike Apple and Apple I think is so much more expensive.another fun thing is the night mode I set a bedtime for me and when it's my bedtime if I'm staying up it goes into a black and white scale mode so everything is in black and white so then I go all right fine yep it's bedtime. I also like the do not disturb because I can have things blocked for when I'm sleeping so my phone isn't ringing or anything and I don't have to remember to put it on silent it was automatically does that. Unless of course it's emergency it is set to if somebody calls back within a 10-15 minute window that it will ring because it's a priority call and I have that turned on. I haven't even come close to using all the storage space that I have on my phone. Whereas my old phone I was constantly having to delete things to get a new app if I wanted to and it was very hard to do, so I like the extra space I like how fast it works and I like the thinness of it actually. As for phone calls and stuff I don't have an issue with the speaker or the earpiece very simple to use and my camera is still working nicely I I still get really nice pictures.this one does say that it's for all carriers and I have Xfinity mobile, and when I got the phone I checked the number against their oh is your phone compatible on the website and it wasn't. I was very frustrated I even set up to start a new return with this but then, I was on with the people on chat and I was trying to figure it out and I even said I was going to try and go somewhere else. But here's the thing even though that they wouldn't help me and they kind of have some sucky customer service. I have a very cheap bill with them I just have to have my cable with them to get them and then each month it's just I think it's like $12 per gigabyte of data that you use and since I don't use data I don't have a bill each month because my phone is paid off I have nothing else going on there so I have a really great deal with them so I want to keep with them so. So before I decided to actually ship it back I pulled my chip card out of my old phone and slid it into this one here and eureka! My phone actually works really well I didn't have to change anything with my carrier all I had to do was change my SIM card and the phone is compatible even if they tell you it's not compatible So I would say give that a try if you do have Xfinity, and then if it works great if not I'm sorry you'll have to look for something else considering the stage shouldn't work but mine works and I've been doing it for two months now and haven't had any disruptions with my service everything has been great and I haven't had to change my billing at all so I have really enjoyed having this phone.I hope my review has been helpful.

       " \"The Pixel 4A is for sure waaayoverrated! I have the Blu Vivo XL4 and much of the 4A is very similar to it! The one feature I hate on the my Blu is the call dialing UI. If an error is made in dialing it can't be corrected, you must start all over again! The 4a has the same exact dialing UI..Apps missing can't reinstall most, Screen is dim even at maximum brightness with high intensity with night light turned off! The 4A has a few improved features and a lot of bloat to disable and block tracking your activity. I was happy to get a new phone with better calling features only for this pixel 4a to have the same calling UI as the $150 Blu phone for $200 more! Ugh ugh. I was stunned! That was the one main thing I was anxious to get rid of!!! A major deal breaker!\",\n",
       " 'I gave this 3 stats because of the software. I felt like google could\\'ve done a better job especially since this is a pure android device. The notification system is stupid.When someone text me and I respond to it from the notification window the text remains there in the notifications. If I\\'m the last person to respond why do I need to see my own .message in the notifications?? That\\'s stupid! If I respond the notification needs to go away!If get a bunch of notifications (emails, text) and I swipe them away, more notifications show up IMMEDIATELY. Sometimes they aren\\'t even new. I literally have to press \"clear all\" 3x for the notifications to go away.I also don\\'t like that if I\\'m on a website that I\\'m trying to upload a image to, the phone sends you on a wild goose chase to find your \"gallery\". By default it brings up \"recent images\" and I think that\\'s dumb. You should be able to choose what it defaults to. Even still when you press on \"camera\" it\\'ll still take you to another screen that you have to press \"camera\" again just to get to the images you took with your camera.These things can be fixed with software but it\\'s super annoying, especiy the notifications. Not to mention I bought a fossil smart watch that runs wear OS and if I check a email from last year, the watch will send me a notification from that email like I just received it! STUPID! FIX THIS STUFF GOOGLE!Battery is ok considering this is a mid level phone. Kinda get what you pay for on that one.',\n",
       " 'The Google Pixel 4a provides the absolute best Android experience, for the cheapest price. Hands down! That cannot be contested. From the software updates (I installed Android 12 yesterday), to the features, to the camera, to the size, display, audio quality...everything. The biggest con might be the processor; it\\'s not the fastest, most buttery experience out there, but by no means is it unstable or frustrating (with the stock Android launcher).But, there is a huge glaring problem with this phone, and it is the screen - and I believe it is a software issue. It is not a common issue, but it affects enough people (myself included) for it to not be ignored. Unfortunately, that is exactly what Google is doing; ignoring this issue.Approximately 3 months after purchasing this phone, an update rendered the screen extremy buggy, making it almost unusable. I mean, I can use it with some trickery here and there, but it is a very frustrating, unreliable experience. After the update, I got 3 dead zones on my screen - two the bottom half, and one at the very top. I can no longer swipe down pull-down the notification tray; I have to turn the phone to landscape or use the fingerprint sensor. Typing is a nightmare, and selecting \"Ok\" and \"Cancel\", and \"Not Now\" prompts are almost impossible. It takes dozens of presses and hoping my finger somehow lands on a miniscule part of the screen that recognises it. Filling it forms? Forget it. Emails? It\\'s quicker to boot up my PC, type it out and send it from there, than using this frustating nightmare of a phone. In fact, just trying to write this review is a pain in the butt - I accidentally hit \"Submit\" four times already, at various points in writing this. And I am absolutely certain this is a software issue, as there are times where it works for brief moments (a few seconds or minutes if I\\'m lucky) before it reverts to this nightmare. Another reason why I know it\\'s a software issue is if I slide my hands over those dead zones quickly enough, the input registers. It\\'s not a fix though, as tapping them is still near impossible.And what is Google doing about it? Absolutely nothing! You should go to Google\\'s support forum - hundreds, upon hundreds of complaints about this issue and the pinch-to-zoom or multi-touch not working - and all Google does, is have their volunteer users suggest factory resets, toggling on/off high-sensitivity mode, booting into safe mode, wait for another update, restarting the phone, or removing the screen protector. How successful were these suggestions? I bought this phone late 2019. A March 2020 update caused the problem. I\\'ve tried all of these things, repeatedly, for months on end, and have updated my phone with every update...recently updating to Android 12, AND THE PROBLEM PERSISTS!I really, really, really want to love this phone. I sort of do; it nails everything for me. But this freaking screen issue is driving me crazy! I feel like I\\'ve wasted my money with this phone. I can\\'t even, in good conscience, sell it to anyone. I love some of the Android features exclusive to Pixels, and I really want to purchase the Pixel 6, but I cannot afford it right now. The 4a is what I can afford, but I\\'m scared to purchase this phone again, with the possibility that I can end up with the same exact problem, and absolutely no care or support from Google.Be warned; this phone is excellent...but only if it works as intended. Good luck.*This is my 6th attempt to write this review. And what should have taken me 3 mins, took 15 :(',\n",

A few times I've actually caught it in the act, just slipping off a surface that I've laid it on, so I've started to put it inside a box or other lipped surface to keep it from walking off.  I suspect the screen and slight lip might be enough to reduce the friction so that even small vibrations can send it off in some direction but I've never caught anything actually doing it, and I didn't have the problem with my old phone (maybe it liked me more?)  It's a cute source of jokes in my house.I've had the phone for about a week and a half and so far am liking it a lot.Pros: Nice weight, good responsivenessCons: Misinterprets light touches, turns off while looking at it.The cons might be something I just need to hunt down settings for.  It seems to be over sensitive when I try to swipe.  It's often drilling down to the next screen when I don't want it to.  It has also shut the screen off during a few tasks, so it is a lot different than my previous phone.That being said, it has the features that I like and is wonderfully nice and responsive, even if it does like skydiving a bit too much.\",\n",

       " \"I have small hands. Most of the phones out there are big now. And I am looking for a small phone that is not premium or flagship priced. And Pixel 4a meets that need. Since there are already excellent reviews in YouTube and Amazon, I will just add my personal experience with the phone. Pixel 4a fits nicely in my hand now. I can use the phone with one hand without fumbling it. My previous phone Moto G7 while great still was a little big for my hands. I do not support iPhone ecosystem, so I was looking for Android. My wife's phone Pixel 3a was great in my hands so I thought I would check out Pixel 4a and it has bigger screen yet smaller than 3a! So I grabbed it and using it for a month, I am really satisfied. Size and weight are perfect and the performance is more than I need (I am not a gamer, so I don't need a powerful processor). The screen is OLED and is clearly better than IPS LCD screens. The colors are just more rich and pop out than IPS LCD. Battery lasts more than 1 full day (my average screen time is between 3 - 4 hours). And the camera! Wow... It is really good. I've heard it was good, but actually seeing it - I was really impressed. The ONLY thing I wish Pixel 4a had was: Water and dust proof feature (IP 68). But for $350, this phone is amazing. And you also get 3 year software update guarantee. So if you are not looking for a premium phone, but something small yet powerful and takes great pictures, then Pixel 4a is an excellent choice! Highly recommended!\",\n",
       " \"I'm glad to have a pure Android experience again with no carrier bloatware and no stupid system modifications from manufacturers like OnePlus. (They are the worst manufacturer in terms of needlessly killing background apps).The camera is fantastic! It's half because of the software and half because of the large pixels in the sensor. It's great in low light. The Night Sight mode is so much fun! On a tripod or some other stable surface, astrophotography mode will engage in Night Sight mode that allows for amazing star photos. The real-time HDR adjustment and preview is really nice. Basically, you tap on some portion of the photo to choose what you want the primary exposure to lock onto (like the bright part of a sunset) then a slider appears that lets you control the fill light. It's wonderful!It got the Android 11 update immediately after I bought it, so that's cool. Lots of nice little updates in that.The default gesture navigation doesn't work well with 3rd party launchers. (I use Nova Launcher). When I swipe up to go to the home screen, I can't tap any icons for 1 second. They don't respond. It's weird. But with the old school 3-button nav it works fine. Swiping up from the bottom also appears to choose the 3rd party launcher and if it were an app, then it reopens it. That might be part of that problem. Neither of these things happen with the default launcher, but that launcher wastes so much space on the clock and the search bar, so I don't like it.The CPU/GPU is plenty fast for me. I don't play much mobile gaming. Just some board games sometimes. The AI in Waterdeep takes it's turns quite a bit faster than on my old OnePlus 3T, so that's nice.Headphone jack and fingerprint reader are a huge plus for me.You get a lot of phone for the price!\",\n",

The lack of waterproofing for me is pointless. All my old phones where the same way. Hardly a disappointment. and no wireless charging?

       " \"I bought the Pixel 4A (Not the 4A 5G) to replace a older HTC model which is no longer being updated. Before buying it I looked at other phones and found that most didn't get regular OS or Security updates or if they did it was months after the update became available which makes me nervous. When looking at a lot of the other phones I found that most came with built in apps that quite frankly I would never use and more often than not you couldn't un install which I don't like one bit. The Pixel 4A came with a lot of google apps (Most of which can be uninstalled which is a breath of fresh air) and the apps that can't be uninstalled like Google assistant (Which is part of the OS) can be completely turned off unlike some other assistant apps from other companies which really helps preserve my privacy. I am extremely pleased and pleasantly surprised with the ability to turn things off or uninstall the apps I don't want. Unlike many people I don't use my phone a lot so I only have to charge it twice a week so batterie life is great!  The phone has worked perfectly since I got it and Over all I am extremely pleased with the purchase!! I would definitely reccomend this phone to anyone!\",\n",

If I were to do it again I might be swayed to get that instead. The camera is just better as is the screen. But I\\'ll be honest -- $349 for an unlocked 4a is hard to beat!

       " 'I love this phone! My old phone was slow and froze frequently within the first few months of having it, but the Pixel 4a has none of those problems!The camera is amazing, and has a lot of great settings and options. I will attach a regular picture and a portrait mode picture to show the clarity and great quality. The camera is also quickly accessable by double tapping the lock button on the side of the phone.I noticed that Google Duo has a share screen feature that is available on the Pixel 4a, but not a lot of other phones, and I enjoy having that option.The fingerprint reader works great.The battery lasts a very long time. I use my phone very frequently and usually charge it to 70 or 80% to preserve battery life. Even with all the usage, I usually only have to charge it once a day. It would definitely take a while to die with a full charge so no worries there.The thing I came across the most while researching the phone prior to purchasing was \"it\\'s a great budget phone\" and I 100% agree. I\\'m no tech expert, but as a regular user, I can say this is the best phone I have ever had.In comparison with the Pixel 4 (which I do not have), the Pixel 4a does have a headphone jack, but does not have wireless charging or the squeeze feature, and is not water-resistant.I have the phone in \"Just Black\" and it is very nice and sleek with a white lock button.There were originally no navigation buttons and the phone directed me to use gestures but I was able to get the navigation buttons that I prefer in the settings.Overall it\\'s a great phone and I highly recommend it.',\n",
       " \"I love Google products. I'm not exaggerating when I say I use them all, both for personal use and as a teacher and scout leader. I bought my first Google Pixel 4a last Sept. 2020. By April 2020 the sensor fingerprint button on the back had broken, I had spent some time on the phone with Google tech troubleshooting the issue, had a major problem with a factory reset (which did not fix the problem). THEN, before getting it into the store, a tiny break on the screen occurred (regular drop, using a case....first time this has ever occurred to me in my entire lifetime of smartphone use, always using the case). When I got it to the store, they wouldn't fix it. They said I would have to pay for both fixes out of pocket...the cost of a new phone. They would not accept the email from Google saying that they would fix the manufacturing issue and let me pay for the other part (the broken screen). I let Google know the response via email and got a total non-response response that did not respond to the problem at all. Then the screen cracked more. Out of time and need a new phone that actually workes for an upcoming trip, I decided to spend the $300 on a new phone so I'd be under warranty for a year. My cell carrier didn't have any Pixel 4a online or in-store, so I bought one on Amazon brand new and it arrived that same day. I'm not joking ... less than 12 hours later, with a case, the brand new phone dropped again ... and broke, worse than the prior phone!! Specs say this is Grorilla Glass 3...that was one of the reasons I bought this phone and a case. I KNOW I'm going to have occasional drops. But this drop was in a case, from 2 feet onto a linoleum style floor. IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BROKEN. That's two phones ... one after 7 months use, one after 12 hours. I've never had a phone that worked so well but with such terrible manufacturing that it breaks so much so often. The worst part is that all I have after multiple emails and now two long phone calls with Google is a promise that if I go back to the contractor Fixit store with the FIRST phone they will back the warranty on the button that broke .... so hey, I can pay $149 bucks to fix the broken phone and I'll be back to ONE working phone again, after spending nearly $800 dollars in one year on two brand new Pixel4as ... DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!! Google doesn't stand behind its own product. Major disappointed customer over here.\",\n",

The extra RAM here is great -- I went through my social media, then went back to a heavy game (GTA SA) and it was surprisingly still in memory! I've noticed the phone gets really hot throughout the day, especially when you're charging and using it for video calls. The phone even said that it would start disabling features due to overheating.

I just kept using my phone until I found what I thought would be a nice upgrade.  The 4a is the right phone for me at the right time.  The cost was so tempting given the specs, I didn't blink.  I got it from Amazon only 3 days after official release.  I love it.  Nothing about it feels inferior to the Pixel XL.  I was able to connect a USB-C cable and transfer my files and settings in about 20 minutes.  I also connected to my main Win 10 machine and updated my music on the new phone and everything went without a hitch.  I found this upgrade process so much easier and smoother than when I upgraded the two family I-phones (6+ and 7+ to 11) Christmas 2019.  Once I set everything up I checked performance and found the new 4a very snappy.  My use is mostly web browsing, email. news, a bit of shopping and Facebook.  Nothing challenging, so I loaded up YouTube TV and watched it in small and full screen while I transferred some of the music files.  I saw no slow downs in playback or the transfer.  From my limited testing around the home office, the camera is pretty nice.  The speakers are about on par with the original Pixel and about what I expected.  The speakers sound fine. With a headphone jack and Bluetooth 5.0, better sound is simple enough to remedy. I know this isn't in depth or a long term review, but in the 24 hours I have had this phone its been great.  I have gotten good battery life too.  Thanks Google for a great phone and Amazon for getting it to me.\",\n",
       " \"While I love the latest Android OS and how responsive this phone is, as well as its great battery life, the phone has one fatal flaw that you need to be aware of. The phone is extremely sensitive to the presence of moisture, and for many of us, it has died in circumstances that any other phone would do just fine in. Mine died when I had it in the pocket of my waterproof ski pants for 2.5 hours on the ski slope, on a rainy day. The pocket was zipped closed the entire time, and I didn't remove the phone from the pocket until I was in my car. The pocket was not wet inside, even the tissue in the pocket was dry. However my phone's display, when turned on, lit up, but was unresponsive to touch. A day later the same. I can see a very slight haze of humidity on the inside of the selfie lens. I suspect the high humidity in the pocket was enough to short out the screen. Buyer beware - I recommend you Google the issue before purchasing.\",\n",
       " \"After using an iPhone 7 for five years (two of those years with a bulky battery case because a small bend in the chassis meant I could not get the battery replaced) I decided to switch back to Android.  I hate the facial recognition compared to fingerprint, missed having a headphone jack and needing to use a dongle to connect to my car stereo, and I also felt that it really isn't necessary to spend $700+ on a new iPhone.  The iPhone SE is pretty basic for $450 and the $350 Google Pixel 4a seemed like a great choice.Look, you already know that this has a great camera, good screen, good fingerprint sensor, headphone jack, etc. - here is why it's a 3/5 for me.  Even with a case, the screen cracked after falling a few feet onto a hard surface after only five weeks of use.  Amazon covered a screen repair which was really awesome, but there is no reason this phone should be so fragile even with a hard case.  I really don't see this lasting more than maybe two years and I'll likely go back to Apple at that point.  Just too many cut corners here.\",\n",
       " \"So I was slightly skeptical about this phone. Some of the reviews worried me a bit. I did a month worth of research on finding the perfect budget phone for myself. Everything was pointing to the pixel 4a. I unfortunately didn't do enough research with my last phone which was the moto g7. I absolutely loved the g5 and just assumed I would love that one as well, and no I didn't. So this was like a really nice upgrade for me. I usually use a phone for at least 2 years and couldn't get past a year with that one. So I'm a heavy phone user from streaming, games here and there, camera and social media. I'm not some tech genius but I do my research. Let me tell you some things I love about this phone.Standout Pros-- The price!-The camera, it's absolutely fantastic. I can't get over how much I love it. My photos on my old phone were terrible. Now I can't stop taking pics.- Minimal bloatware. Not a whole lot is preloaded onto this phone which is great.- How light it is. Old phone was so heavy my hand would fall asleep. This is a great weight.-The features, I love some of the great things this phone can do. Such as the picking up of music around you. There are a bunch of things I really enjoy but just go watch a good review on youtube if you want to see them all.Cons--Extremely crappy case selection lol. Literally that's the only con I have so far and it's a small one.Although I do have to say that everyone was raving about the pixel 4a's battery life. And I have to say it's pretty good. It's about the same as my old phone. It's not insane as I thought it was going to be. It's not a con because it's not bad in any way. Just thought I would mention it's not as mind blowing as it was made out to be. Also I thought I'd mention that my old phone had a 6.2 inch screen and this is obviously smaller. I don't even miss or notice the smaller screen. I was a little hesitant on the smaller screen of the pixel. But almost immediately I didn't even notice the difference. I actually enjoy having a slightly smaller phone.The shipping was great from this seller as well.These were just a few Standout things from an average person like me. I use my phone for absolutely everything and a quality phone is extremely important. I look forward to using this phone for 2+ years at least. I hope some of this helps anyone on the fence!\",\n",
       " 'I have always had expensive iPhones (over $1 K), but now that I am retired I cannot afford that kind of money for a phone. I am also totally SICK of Apple, as their security on phones and iCloud is so extreme and bizarre that I have wasted many hours on their help line. Did you know that if Apple mistakingly thinks you are in Hong Kong, they will change your entire phone to traditional Chinese? That took me 5 hours on the phone to rectify. And puzzles me ... even if I WAS suddenly in Hong Kong, I would NOT suddenly start reading and speaking in traditional Chinese. In any event, I could not take the stress any more, so I decided to take the BIG step of divorcing Apple and moving to Android. I expected to have a big learning curve, but I just watched a few YouTube videos, and the transition was seamless. Within 24 hours I was IN LOVE with this phone. The screen is gorgeous, the speed is more than good enough, the battery life is awesome, and the apps are marvelous. It can do EVERYTHING my iPhones used to do. The difference is that downloading my photos to my computer is easy and a sheer pleasure. I NEVER get locked out because, for example, I have travelled to Mexico and suddenly Apple is suspicious of me. Oh, and the camera is super important to me. That is why, after a lot of research, I chose this particular phone. Well, the camera is outstandingly excellent. I am thrilled about the astral photography. For a third of the price I paid for my iPhone 6, I now have a camera that is about 3x better. I just LOVE LOVE LOVE this phone - the best one I have ever had in my life. And this is coming from someone who has had decades of flagship phones from Apple. I feel sorry for all those who still think that nothing but an iPhone would do.

Have been a long time Moto phone user, but was disappointed in the G6 and the reviews for the newest model didn't look good, so decided it was time to move to another brand. Couldn't be happier with the Pixel 4A.It was easy to setup and transfer my apps and files with the included cord that plugged into my old phone. Inserted my old verizon sim card and I was in business in minutes.I was most excited to check out the camera, which was highly rated. Very pleased with the pictures so far. The details and colors on close up shots of flowers really pop. Excited to see more on my trip to Glacier later this summer.Some reviews say battery life isn't great, but that has not been my experience. Generally have had around 75 percent left at the end of the day. The test will be travelling here in the northern plains as we go in and out of cell coverage, but so far really happy with the battery life.\",\n",
       " 'Started getting error messages saying \"network not available\" - took it to my carrier & they suggested soft reset, which fixed but only temporarily. I would have to reset phone 3-4 times a day, never knowing when it would be working or not. Then new message appeared - \"no SIM card emergency calls only\" so carrier replaced SIM card, didn\\'t fix the problem. Discovered on chat rooms this is common problem with Pixel 4a, called Google Support and since phone is under warranty, they said take to their partner IBreakUFix Store for repair. It\\'s still there after a week awaiting authorization from Google for repairs. Both the repair store and I have called Google several times asking about this and they are NO help - the repair store cannot get them to respond.WARNING is that I\\'ve discovered through chats and the repair store is that (1) many of these phones are having similar issues so you may easily get a lemon like me and (2) Google tech support isn\\'t worth sh*t.',\n",
       " \"I originally had a Pixel 3a for a year but decided to sell it in May 2020 to try something else. I went to a Xiaomi Note 9 Pro, Samsung S20 FE, Realme 6 Pro, Samsung S20 FE again, and now the Pixel 4a. I could have avoided all of those phones if I just stuck with Pixel. The instant security and OS updates, compact form factor, ease of flashing custom ROMs and reverting back to stock with Google's online tool, excellent battery life, and bloat free, fast software experience are what make Pixel the best. I commonly get 6.5hrs screen on time with auto brightness and light theme on. Although I really enjoyed the Xiaomi and Realme, they do not support VoLTE and WiFi calling in the US with US carriers. Samsung even though they have the best hardware, OneUI is by far my least favorite Android skin. I was GLAD to lose the superior screen, speakers, 5G, 120Hz, and WiFi 6 on the S20 FE to go to the lesser Pixel because the software experience is just that much faster and better. I forgot how much faster and more accurate physical fingerprint readers were compared to the in screen ones. Pixel 4a is definitely the phone you should go for. In my experience, 5G in my area is really not better, if not worse than 4G LTE especially since the 5G in my area is low band non stand alone. The 5G speeds were the same as 4G and I experienced higher latency in certain areas. For this reason I'd choose the 4a over the 4a 5G unless you want the bigger screen. The 4a should have been $299 to compete more with the OnePlus Nord N10 but the extra $50 is well worth it for the longer software support Pixel provides. Overall an excellent phone and I HIGHLY recommend it after having used most major phone brands within a short period of time.\",\n",
       " 'I got this phone specifically because a beloved family member went into the hospital and, recognizing the start of a long and stressful season for my family, I did not want to be working with a less-than-excellent mobile phone.Stupid decision. Because we we\\'ve been in crisis mode since, I did not have time to return the phone, and now I get to decide whether to eat the cost... though it might be worth it to take a hammer to the thing.Problem 1--It is difficult to answer phone calls. Sometimes it shows me the \"dismiss / answer\" options to swipe, but sometimes my phone rings without anything changing on the screen, and I have to go to the home screen and choose the phone icon and if I\\'m lucky, I can see the call as perhaps the 3rd notification. I looked for one-touch answering under \"Accessibility\" and--surprise! NOT included.Worse, though? TWICE now, in the middle of an emergency, this phone has LOST CONNECTION TO ITS SIM CARD. No bars -- just a black triangle with an X on it. While I can text, I can neither make nor receive calls until, for some unknown reason, it fixes itself. The first time this happened, research showed me that a \"quirk\" of the 4a is that if you put it into airplane mode, it may not recognize your efforts to dismiss airplane mode. That took me two hours to find out. The second time? Neither the \"airplane mode\" nor the \"reboot\" fix worked.  I never found out what was wrong, because I was too busy texting nurses and family members and driving across town in emergency mode WITHOUT A WORKING PHONE.So no. No, I do not recommend this phone. I wish I had never bought it.',\n",
       " \"I really wanted to like this phone. I anxiously waited 20 days to receive it just to be let down. BIG TIME. The touch responsiveness is VERY laggy. Forget typing actual words when texting. The keyboard lags and chooses the wrong letters. I wouldn't know how the camera is considering when it is opened it freezes the phone. The fingerprint unlock is slow. The battery life is so so. I'm not crazy about the weight of the phone, it feels very light almost like I'm holding a toy phone. I'm really disappointed. This is the first AND last Pixel phone I will own. Unfortunately I will have to keep it as I can't be bothered to go through the hassle of returning and waiting for a refund and searching for a new phone. I was excited for this phone as it was in my price range, so it's a big letdown..I should have just saved up the money for an S20\",\n",

I really don't want to say I'd prefer an iPhone, but I have a new iPad and iOS has gotten a lot better, while Android has gotten worst. And I've been pro-Android for a LONG time now...but like I said: I'm losing my patience. The hardware on this 4A is great...but the OS has turned into a mess.\",\n",

They said they would exchange it for a google 4a 5g phone.  When I looked at their exchange order , it was for the same phone.  I asked to speak to a supervisor, She kept breaking up.  I told her that listing the cellular as 5g was false advertising.  She said I could only exchange it for the same phone I ordered and hung up.

       " \"This phone is amazing. As someone who was in need of an upgrade on the android side of cell phones, I went with this phone simply because of the various positive reviews a saw of it on YouTube. I for one wanted a good camera on my phone and this device meets my need. Although video can be better, it is still usable. The still photos are awesome, no complaints there! It's an easy to use phone with good battery life and smooth performance. In my opinion, you are getting more for what you pay for.

The phone does take excellent pictures unlike my previous phone.  However, the manueverability between screens is just cumbersome.  The gesture to see all the screens that are open is almost the same as the gesture to bring up the menu of all apps.  It is difficult to get the back screen gesture to work.  I have to gesture across the screen from right to left two or three times before it responds.  The volume is fairly low even at the highest setting.  For me, this wasn't a great choice.\",\n",

       " '[May 7, 2021 thoughts on Pixel 4a, ordered November 8, 2020 and used daily ever since]PROS:Form factor and weight-This is the best marriage I have found. Fantastic screen real estate, sensible (ideal?) resolution, and just terrific dimensions for me. This thing is light weight for its size, and I love that more than I can possibly express. Hand fatigue has been all but completely eliminated. Give me plastics, baby! I have no desire for metals that don\\'t add to functionality (and apparently, from something I saw on YouTube, this phone is insanely rugged, even with a plastic shell). Glass is always heavier and less durable than other materials choices, and it\\'s just altogether not well suited for the backside of a mobile handset, IMO. I think Apple charges $550 to replace the back glass on most modern iPhones. This Pixel 4a is the total package and stickers for $200 less than the price of Apple\\'s back glass repair.Price:Performance-While I can\\'t compare this phone to another of its kind with a higher performing Qualcomm, I am never wanting for speed. This phone has been wonderfully fluid and performant for my day-to-day needs. The lean Android experience on the Pixel line really lets its mid-range Qualcomm shine. I most recently carried both an iPhone 7 Plus and 2020 SE, and both proved plenty fast for anything I do; this 4a is no exception.Background app refreshes seem to be on par with what I had using 3GB iPhones. No real surprises. My day-to-day habits seem mostly unaffected by any background app refreshes I\\'ve noticed. I think the 6GB of memory strikes a good balance for the 4a.I don\\'t game. Well, I play some chess now and again, including occasional analysis using very demanding engines (Stockfish, etc), but in general I can\\'t comment on gaming performance.Battery-Battery life and charging time have been lovely. I seldom charge to 100-percent, instead I prefer to just give little 5- to 15-minute charges periodically during the day, while keeping the battery in the 30- to 70-percent range where possible. This thing charges way, way faster than my older 7 Plus and 2020 SE iPhones and overall battery life is likely comparable or better from what I can gather (very unscientifically). I leave it to the readers to determine how important battery life is and do some research of their own.Camera-It\\'s so good it doesn\\'t even make sense. Shooting stills, the 4a smashes my old iPhone 7 Plus my a wide margin and the 2020 SE couldn\\'t hold a candle either. I think that\\'s being objective. I\\'ve had quite a bit of low-level, professional photography training at University level and time behind the lens of DSLRs, and I\\'m quite astonishing that I can get such quality images from the 4a. The software image processing is pure magic.I have kids, and they\\'re the important subjects for me. I\\'d guessed the 4a might struggle with motion, particularly in lower light, which would have been a deal-breaker for me, but this thing takes \"keepers\" practically every single time. Glorious. Most already know how well Pixel phones shoot non-moving subjects, so I won\\'t carry on about that. It\\'s an exciting camera experience. Concerning video, the 1080p 30- and 60-frame shooting has not disappointed either, and the image stabilization is truly excellent. I don\\'t mess with 4k on phones (yet), so no comment there. I don\\'t take selfies, so I won\\'t comment on the front-facing camera either.Android-The gesture navigation is fantastic, particularly the ability to go back by swiping in from either the left- or right-hand side of the display. Massively convenient and easy on the hands.Updates/security patches are crucial for me, and with a Pixel, scorching fast updates are what you get, and support duration bests most Android-based OEMs.Fingerprint recognition-Works as well and as fast as any I\\'ve experienced. Thought the rear placement would bug me. It absolutely does not. Rear placement is probably my preference now. Well executed. I like.CONS:Audio volume/intensity-The 4a just doesn\\'t get as loud as some other modern handsets. It\\'s tricky to listen to a podcast or whatever when I\\'m doing dishes, for example. That said, the audio quality is perfectly satisfactory, to me.Google Search-There\\'s a Google search bar installed by default on the home screen. I leave mine there and find it useful. When tapped, you\\'re presented with the ability to \"search apps, web, and more...\" (much like the search on iOS when you pull down from the top). Google/Android learns over time, so that eventually it can quickly present you with what you\\'re most likely to want. Works great, more often than not. But the problem for me is that it\\'s inconsistent with regards to displaying apps. It must be that about 20-percent of the time it doesn\\'t display apps, so I\\'m forced to swipe up from the bottom of the display to close the interface, then tap the Google search bar again before it populates apps in the query. I can\\'t figure out what causes this for the life of me, and I\\'ve owned an IT MSP for years, so this ain\\'t my first rodeo with tech devices! Frustrating, but muscle memory makes this only a half-second affair to correct.Dependability-I\\'ve long used the same MVNO for cell service, which I mention only because there exists a small possibility that it\\'s of importance here: I\\'ve found a few occasions where I can\\'t place phone calls. To fix, for some reason, a reboot was required. I haven\\'t had any issues in the past few months, but it\\'s probably because I\\'ve changed habits; now, whenever there\\'s an update to something low-level from Android (not just a basic app update), I reboot the phone. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure?? Anyway, I\\'d have a \"need\" to reboot an iPhone maybe once every six months, outside of forced reboots from doing an iOS update. To have had to monthly (or maybe even more frequently) reboot this 4a in order to connect phone calls (with no warning as to any trouble, unless I attempted to place a call and \"connect the dots\") is unfortunate. I don\\'t like to have to think about mitigating critically buggy behavior by rebooting my phone from time to time.OLED-I\\'m sensitive to flicker, so I basically hate OLED. My daily driver laptop is a ThinkPad T480s LARGELY because its 1080p IPS is flicker-free (no PWM). This 4a gives me viewing fatigue after a relatively short while. On the 4a, unless you\\'re at max brightness (exactly 100-percent), you can expect flicker in the ~122 to 255Hz range. That\\'s too low for me. I would prefer an LCD, like the ones I had in my iPhone 7 Plus or 2020 SE. I could view those endlessly without fatigue- read books on them, you name it. But the industry does trend, and trend it does for the contrast ratio specs and inky blacks the kids rave about these days {rolls eyes}.Overall:This is probably the finest overall set of compromises I\\'ve ever found in a cell phone, and I\\'ve owned many of them since 1994. I\\'m highly satisfied with this handset, and I think very little could realistically be done today to improve upon the formula that is the Pixel 4a. Google has made a proper phone for adults.9/10 DO recommend!',\n",
       " \"Highly recommended. Easy to use, great battery life, great camera, up-to-date and clean version of Android without the usual manufacturer bloatware. One downside is that it doesn't have an SD card slot, but I'm finding the 128gb builtin storage is more than enough for now. I bought this as a replacement for a Motorola Moto Z2 Play phone after the front glass started to separate from the frame. The Motorola was a little bigger than the Pixel 4a (and a little unwieldy if the truth be told)  but to my mind the smaller size of the Pixel 4a makes it easy to handle, certainly one-handed. Though smaller in overall size the whole-screen display of the Pixel 4a seems to be about the same size as that of the Motorola and I find it runs a bit faster than the Motorola too. Overall very pleased with the new phone .\",\n",

       " 'This phone for one thing has an awesome camera which I use for everything. I was getting so used to not getting clear sharp or correctly exposed photos with the Moto I had before. I struggled to get a clear closeup or sometimes even distant photos with the Moto. With this phone I am amazed, I get nicely exposed and clear pictures in all light levels. I use my phone to document items and even documents using the photo scan app and it works perfectly. I couldn’t have done that with Moto it just wouldn’t happen the camera and app on Motorola is horrible and I got no help from Motorola at all it’s a defect numerous people have. With this camera I have none of that the pics are just crystal clear and I don’t have to stand on my head and pray just for a good pic. Thanks Google. I like google everything it just works! Thank you! I can get perfect pictures for my reviews on Google maps and Amazon etc. I couldn’t do that before! The camera is important to me because I don’t carry my big digital camera anymore it’s just to much hassle. I want a nice clear picture taking camera that’s easy to use and quick! I use the camera more than phone calls and text so I really love this phone! I find that the camera functions can do very extensive things and for once they are easy to use which I didn’t have before. Google please keep it up make a camera that is good and easy to use and just works! I haven’t commented on the actual phone functions as I just live for the camera! I use it to document my old pictures and convert them to digital and store them on Google Photos, love it. I’ve done the old way trying to store on a desktop computer on hard drives, discs and flash drives and a scanner. Not anymore I had to re digitize my old paper pictures to google and I can access them effortlessly using Google Photos. I’m sold, I use Google for everything now. I’m 65 and this digital apps, camera phone and Google pics is just so much easier to do. The camera itself works excellent and menus are so much better and easier to use. I will probably be back to revisit this review as I discover more things about the Pixel 4a. Thanks again for a good phone at a reasonable cost.',\n",
       " \"I really like what Google is doing for the midrange consumers like myself.Coming from a Pixel 2 I was a bit let down about the performance downgrade, despite better battery life.  After some time using the phone I haven't noticed much lag aside from the camera's render time.It takes 5-10 seconds to fully render a new picture which is pretty significant delay.  My images look horrible during the render process and there's no eta shown, just have to keep opening it.  Images look really great after the render is complete but the lack of a timer or indicator of rendering is off-putting.Speakers also sounded significantly better on the pixel 2 but at least I can still hear the 4a's speakers.All other apps run smoothly and my battery life and recharge rate has made this a pleasure to use as a delivery driver with maps open 100% of the time.  There are better options out there for battery life, but with much compromise in other areas.As a former Verizon wireless sales associate and tech nerd I highly recommend this phone if your budget is below $500, at the time of this review.  There are some minor shortcomings of the device but overall I think the sacrifices made to make the phone only $350 are perfect.\",\n",
       " \"I don’t know why. Maybe it’s because I upgraded to Android 11. My camera can no longer be used normally. I can’t use the rear lens without dropping it on the ground or getting water. After turning the camera apps on, there is a black screen. I need to wait a few minutes to see the image. Even if I see the image, it is blurred and out of focus, and it will get stuck immediately. This makes me very bad for the pixel 4a. I think the core advantage of the pixel 4a as a cheap phone is that its camera function is comparable to flagship phones. But when I can no longer use its camera function, it loses its appeal to me. Can’t use the rear the lens is a problem even for daily use. I can't even scan the QR Code. I am quite disappointed with Google phones. I hope someone can help me solve the problem. I have tried using safe mode, using Third-party camera software, clearing camera data, and even Restoring the phone to the factory settings, but I still can't restore my camera functions.\",\n",
       " \"The phone was decent when it was working. Nothing great, but ok.

Worst phone experience I've had.**As an update, my claim has been denied and they are returning my defective, non-functional phone as is.

       " \"I love this phone. Please keep in mind, I've never owned a flagship phone, usually sticking to phones I could buy outright for less than $200.That said, I was ready for a new phone and did a lot of research. I also had a chance to spend some time with a Pixel 4 to compare it. So the following are my impressions:First off, what's different from the Pixel 4: You are missing the aluminum frame, the facial recognition, the edge squeeze, the water resistance, a specific camera lens and some camera features, wireless charging, and an 800 series processor. I think that's about it.The thing is, other than the water resistance, I personally don't miss any of that.What you get in return is a slightly bigger screen, a better battery, and a brighter screen (you have to use adaptive brightness for it to work). This is also a fair bit lighter. Also a personal preference is that I prefer the fingerprint reader over facial recognition.For me it's the perfect little phone. Full disclosure, I paid about $260 since I bought it from Amazon Warehouse. Nonetheless, this phone hits all the right spots for me. It is light, it has a clear and bright screen, it is fast, takes amazing pictures, it isn't bloated with preinstalled apps, and is future proof in that you can update for 3 years, the sound is pretty great, and honestly I can't find much to complain about.The only thing I wish this had was the water resistance. Accidents happen. Also keep in mind that this is plastic with an outdated Guerilla 3 screen. Buy a case. Buy a screen protector. If you do, I can't see why this phone won't be a great phone for you unless you only buy the $1000 flagships with all the bells and whistles, in which case, why are you even reading this review?One last thought. The battery is fine by me. I can make it through the day and longer with moderate use. No wireless charging, but it charges from zero to full in pretty much less than an hour, so I always find time within the day to plug it in and then I'm good to go. Usually at dinner time or whatever when I don't want to be disturbed anyway.Had a chance to to go with the Pixel 4, chose to go with this instead (mostly because the Pixel 4 screen is waaaaay to dim). Thanks Google for this amazing cheap phone!\",\n",
       " \"I purchased my Pixel 4a for a couple of reasons. My iPhone 7 Plus was getting a little long in the tooth and I'd been considering an upgrade but even as an iPhone user since the original one, I'd become a bit turned off by ever increasing pricing on Apple's phones. Also, as a product of the Walkman generation I really missed having a headphone jack. Fast forward four months and I'm using an iPhone 12 Pro Max.. what went wrong?Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The Pixel 4a is a really great phone. Nice form factor, always on display, fast and responsive fingerprint reader, a headphone jack and frequent updates to its operating system. My only real misgiving is the lack of wireless charging, which is quickly becoming essential to me. This is a great phone that you can customize to your heart's content, and if you're not entrenched in Apple's ecosystem you can probably go ahead and purchase without any reservations. I say 'probably', because I felt very ready to pick up and move away from Apple's ecosystem, however your circle of friend, family and co-workers should be taken into account. What do the people in your life use? If it's primarily iPhone, that may provide some friction to your transition over to Android. In my case I found that not being connected to iMessage and Facetime was enough of an inconvenience that I was using my iPod Touch to replace the features I no longer had access to on my phone. Silly, right? That was my conclusion, and I went ahead and bought an iPhone 12 Pro Max.Do I LIKE one more than the other? I suppose the iPhone 12 does feel a bit more premium, due largely to the fact that it is... I don't think it's a question of 'like', though. Your phone is more a question of fit for your life, and as positively as I felt about the Pixel 4a, the fit wasn't quite right. Things may be different for you, but I can stand behind the Pixel 4a as a quality phone and a bargain at its list price.\",\n",
       " \"Not very pleased with the pixel 4a.The back function is not ideal.  All to often it closes the app or page instead of backing up just one screen.  Can get frustrating when comparing items or info on the internet.  The bluetooth will not connect to my vehicle.  The phone says it cannot communicate with the car system.  All my other phones have and still do.  Looking on the pixel issues posted, other people are having similar issues.  If I can't find a fix to connect, I may return as I'm not trading cars..The wifi and network connection is fine, no problem s, speed of phone is acceptable.  If it would only connect to kenwood car components it would be an acceptable phone.  Handsfree driving is important to me.\",\n",
       " \"While I work in the space of mobile applications I tend to hold off on upgrading my phone until the last minute of my phone's life. Upgrading to this from the OG Pixel was a great transition. There were things about the other Pixel phones that I didn't like so I waited until one had what I needed. Headphone jack, thank goodness. I'm old and still love having this as an option because I have older equipment here and there that it's just a lot easier. Fingerprint reader on the back of the phone again; this is one thing that the OG Pixel had that I really loved. It became second nature so I really wanted it back. The battery life on this phone is fantastic so far. I would say with moderate use I could probably get 2 days out of it on a charge. It also charges fairly quickly. For performance, it does exceptionally well for the  price range and it's all I need. The camera takes pretty great pictures, and does well with portrait mode even better than the iPhone SE. (It recognizes my dog so I'm happy haha). The only downsides to this phone for me would be no wireless charging and it is not 5G ready. I knew this going into it and honestly I can't live without those things for another couple of iterations. The phone is very intuitive and a great experience.\",\n",

DO NOT PURCHASE THIS IF YOU HAVE T-MOBILE!\",\n",
       " \"I was using the Pixel 3 previously. Processing power-wise it was a down grade but bought this phone because my pixel 3 was starting to stutter at times and I just loved the way the display on the Pixel 4a looked. After receiving the phone- the phone felt really nice on the hands: outer plastic shell didn't feel cheap nor plasticky as many youtube reviewers stated(feels solid to me atleast). Also the curvature of the side well complimented the gesture navigation(going back gesture).- full display mode on youtube is awesome as expected(the bottom left punch hole is rarely noticeable due to its position in horizontal mode). Although the space between the top edge of the display and the status bar is quite noticable and would've been better if the gap was shorter.- also the display brightness seems slightly lower than the pixel 3 but nothing serious.- haptics feels identical to the Pixel 3 and happy that google did not cheap on this part.- apps not supporting the display ratio/size has a slim cutoff on the bottom of the display. Also, the status bar part is unutilised on all apps, which is a bummer but again not critical.- photo takes a split second more to process/save right after taking one, but besides this occasion I don't feel any noticeable processing speed difference on daily tasks compared to the Pixel 3(probably gaming will feel materially different but personally I don't game with my phone so no complaints on processing power).Overall, really enjoying the display and the design.\",\n",
       " \"My phone died and I needed a new one fast, so I bought a Pixel 4a based on all the glowing recommendations from friends.Turns out they were talking about the 4a5G, which not only has 5g support, it is a bigger phone with a larger screen.Don't get me wrong, the 4a is a fine device, but the screen is small enough that some modern apps are hard to use.\",\n",
       " \"This was quite a step up for me going from a HTC Desire 526 smart phone to the Google Pixel 4a smartphone. I like the fact that it is unlocked. Never buy a phone that is not. In that way you can take it to the carrier of your choice. I've been with Verizon for 4 years now. And they keep giving me perks for my loyalty so you never bite the hand that feeds you. Now about the phone itself. I like the fact it had a transfer device with it so transferring my files, pics, and contacts was very easy for me and granted I am not real techie but I can do a few things without help. I like the fact it has 128gb of internal memory so no need for an internal micro sd card. Great camera too. I like you can set it to block out telemarketers. It takes very little time to charge it and the charge lasts a very long time. 12 hours approximately depending on what you do with your phone. I am NOT a gamer as I view it as a big waste of time. The phone has limitless potentials. I like the OLED screen too. It's very light and thin which is nice. I do suggest you get a good rubber armor for it which I did. People I talk to ask me what kind of phone I am on now because I sound really good on it. You won't experience drop calls on this phone no matter where you are. I'm 68 years young and hope this will be the last phone I will ever own until the day they put me in a box.  It has a great assortment of ringer sounds to choose from or if you don't want to be disturbed you can set it to that too. Great Wi-Fi too and you can turn it into your own private Wi-Fi hotspot if you choose to do so. Which I think is very cool. I don't think you can go wrong with this phone as like I said before the potentials of what it can do seem to be limitless. Also the learning curve is quite easy and it's an Android. Iphones are just a name and you pay dearly for it. I'll stick to Android phones. In conclusion, I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a very functional and efficient/proficient phone.  Buy it. You won't regret it.\",\n",
       " \"Oh my goodness!! This is the worst phone ever!! I'm still trying to figure everything out after 7 days of using it! Nothing is easy and actually at this time I can't get it to show me all of my apps, which it did yesterday but not today!! Don't buy!!!!\",\n",
       " \"Is the camera super high resolution? No, but the processing is great and you don't need more than 4,000 pixels wide for social media posts. Is the battery super high capacity? No again, but I never need to charge it more than once per day, and at the end of the day I still have 20 hours of battery left. Maybe if you shoot a lot of video this phone wouldn't hold out long, but for my very average usage it's fine. Does it have a fancy glass or metal case? No, but most people with fancy looking phones put a case on them anyway. Or they crack.Does it have a punch hole camera? Yes, and here's my only major gripe. I never use the selfie camera, and Netflix seems to be the only major streaming app that can stretch to full screen. All of the other apps I have (Hulu, HBO Max, Prime Video) slam the video to the right hand side which will round off the corners of 16:9 video. The punch hole itself doesn't even bother me anymore. I just want full screen video in my streaming apps, and it's not even Google's fault on this one.The verdict is that the Pixel 4a is a solid budget smartphone. It gets regular security updates, is probably getting Android 12, doesn't have a terrible app launcher, and isn't going to crack like my glass back Motorola X4.\",\n",
       " 'I am not a smart phone afficionado, but I am not technically illiterate.  The Pixel 4a is strangely glitchy.  I am on my second one after my cat sent the first plummeting to its death facedown on a tile floor, and both of my Pixels have had issues.The phone is affordable and the camera is decent.  I frequently use the voice-to-text feature, but it does not work very well and frequently makes errors.  (Strangely, when I used it whilst brushing my teeth, it was perfect.  Riddle me that.)  Despite frequent texting, it does not seem to have learned any of my preferences and autocorrects things that I do not want changed.  When I try to give it verbal commands starting with, \"Okay, Google,\" it only seldom responds.  The phone has sometimes unlocked itself whilst in my pocket and I cannot explain how, as a pin is required.  I will hear the sound of buttons being pressed on the phone, pull it out of my pocket, and find the phone deep in my settings or in the middle of a nonsensical text.  This phone also randomly deletes addresses from my contacts list.  The phone numbers are intact, but any other information listed under a contact disappears.  I know I saved it properly because I will use the navigation system to go to a house, but when I try to pull it up a couple months later, it is gone.My first Pixel 4a would have an issue where the screen would take on a very yellow hue.  I thought it was an issue with the settings, but no amount of fiddling could make it stop.  Turning the phone off and on again would work...after a while.  Once being turned on again, the screen would still be yellow, and then after a few minutes would revert to the normal setting.  Then one day, it got stuck on yellow and stayed that way for a month.  I have no idea if there was a fix to be had, for my cat broke it and I got another.So why did I buy another with all these issues?  It is affordable and I was in a hectic situation and wanted my information to transfer easily from phone to phone.  I was able to get another one of these the same day the first one broke.  Sadly, the information DID NOT completely transfer from the first Pixel 4a to the second.As far as durability, the first Pixel 4a was in a protective case with protective glass on the screen and survived many tumbles to the ground in its time, surviving both asphalt and concrete.  A four-foot plunge facedown onto a tile floor, however, was its undoing.  The screen remained intact, but something internally was damaged and the screen would no longer display, though I could hear from the alerts that the software was still working.All in all, I think Google has a lot more work to do on the Pixels if mine are any indication.  I do like the price point, the display, the sound, call quality, and the photo quality is fine for my needs.  Just write down your contacts addresses somewhere else so you don\\'t lose them.',\n",

After using the pixel 4a for 2 days, I can easily say this is my favorite phone of the bunch. Very happy with the placement and speed of the fingerprint reader as opposed to the not so accurate one on the one plus and s20 on screen fingerprint. Very happy with the battery life, as opposed to the crappy battery on the S20 with exynos chip. My favorite camera to take photos, just like the pixel 4. Best software experience, same as the pixel 4, and finally it costs 350 dollars, which is only half the price of the least expensive phone on the list!!!! This is by far the best value for money I have ever seen in a phone. Biggest downside was the 60 hz refresh rate after coming from the 120 hz in the S20, but I can\\'t really complain given this is marketed as a \"budget phone\". If you are just looking for the basics in a phone and want consistency, this is the phone to get.',\n",
       " 'I went from a Galaxy S7 to this Pixel 4A 5 days ago. So far I like it. It is very similar to the S7 in overall size, but without the bezels the screen is bigger. Most functions seem similar, I\\'m not sure what the raves about a \"pure Android experience\" are about. I don\\'t trust and don\\'t use either the facial recognition or fingerprint reader, so I just gave them a middle star rating. The speakers are loud enough for me and I have a some age related hearing deficit. I\\'ve always used an ATT store to set up my phones before, but they told me they no longer do that for unlocked phones, despite paying upfront for their network for the past 8 years. I followed Google\\'s online instructions for transferring the data from my S7 and they worked fine. The only irritating thing was that the directions said the box contained an adapter for attaching a USB C cable to a USB micro; it doesn\\'t. It is an adapter for connecting a full size USB to the USB C in the box. So I had to go get a full size USB to USB Micro cable. Overall, I can\\'t see a lot of difference between this phone and my previous S7, except that I now get security updates for Android and the S7 no longer does. Why pay $700+ for a \"flagship phone\" when this does the job for half the price or much less? And 5G? Give me a break. Lots of hype and no benefits so far. I don\\'t expect to see a benefit in my rural area for many years and it still doesn\\'t work any better than 4G LTE in downtown Denver where my wife\\'s office is. So, a middle of the line phone works very well and this was the best I could find for my purposes.',\n",
       " \"For 3 years I had been waiting for Motorola to come out with a suitable replacement for my old, cracked screen Moto G5 Plus. I waited in vain.  All that were available in the US were gimmicky phones like the stylus. And they got ever larger too.The Pixel 4a is just right.  It fits comfortably in my hand.  It's feels lighter than my Moto. The on/off button is located high on the right side where it is out of the way -- I don't press it every time I pick up the phone. The fingerprint reader is located on the back where it can be operated one-handed, also out of the way so it is not triggered every time I touch the bottom of the screen. There is only an occasional problem with fingerprint recognition, not enough to complain about.  I think they got the basic ergonomics right.The phone screen itself is bright enough to see outside. The calls are clear and volume is good. The screen is sharp.I have no problems getting a couple days regular usage from the battery. The processor feels fast -- I don't have to wait for apps to respond to input.All in all I'm very satisfied with this phone.\",\n",

Impressed with how Google focused on the important things like camera, smart OS, headphone jack, buttery smooth functionality, finger sensor, and simplicity. Plus its really smart. Satisfied with how they mastered the necessary things and dropped the frivolous features like wireless charging, waterproof, face ID and glass body on the 4a. The camera alone is worth $350. Seriously, go watch reviews. It is absolutely mind-blowing how great this phone is for the price. I highly recommend it.',\n",

I get two and a half days out of the battery but I also don\\'t live on my phone. One of the great things is no bloatware, what a nice change. This phone basically set itself up, a bit of a letdown for someone who enjoys \"tinkering\" with things. I do like the fingerprint reader. If it will work on my fingers, it should work for anyone. Great camera, a first for me, settings I expect to find on my SLR not a phone. I really haven\\'t got to try it but I will try to report what I think later on.

I\\'m still not going to get rid of the Nikon. It\\'s nice for those moments when you say \"I wish I had a camera\". It seems I find a new feature every day.

       " \"I've never broken one of my phones before.  I had this phone fewer than 9 months before it took a decent blow and became inoperable.  I suppose the amount of time I had it before it got beaten is irrelevant, but who says you're supposed to think while reading product reviews!?It suffered an arguably sharp, blunt hit to the poly carbonate rear case and the phone shows no signs of damage whatsoever.  Not sure if the screen broke or the mainboard broke, but it now shows nothing but a garbled, distorted green grid of nonsense for a few seconds when powered on.  The reason I mention all this is because this is one of the few premium-ish phones that does not have a metal, glass or ceramic body.  A HARD outer shell may very well be worth the extra cost... the phone was in a case when it took its fatal blow.As far as living with the phone day in and day out, pretty good.  Worked really well on Fi.  Great coverage, decent enough camera, responsive, adequate battery for how I use it.  Really kinda my favorite phone, and no frills.  Too bad it's not able to better tolerate the inevitable oopsie.Again, never broke one of my phones before.  Typically the battery becomes usable or I just feel like having something new after 18 months or so before I get a new one.  Really bummed to have this thing leave my completely high and dry from what I consider to be an otherwise nearly inconsequential incident.Would I recommend it?  Yes, if you're even more careful than I've been in my phone-ownership career (15 years or so) and if you get a great big stupid case for it and never take it out.RIP, little Pixel 4a\",\n",
       " \"I was using a Moto 4G Plus for many years. Then it just bricked. It was time to get a new one. My husband has been pleased with his Pixel so I looked at them too.My pros:* Great little phone if you like smaller screen* No bloatware. You can remove some of the little extras Google puts on there but it's nothing like Samsung's cramware or other phones (this is why I stayed with Motorola too - nothing to take up all your space other than the OS)* Latest Android features, which became increasingly important to me. Not all phones keep up. My Moto was two versions behind - what a detriment!* Battery life is pretty good* Long lasting phones with little troubles...you can have this phone for years and be happy and trouble free!My cons:* Small! I was used to the Moto's larger screen. This is so small. I should have gone into the store to look at the phones - I'd have gone with a larger screen Pixel. I'm older and have eye issues and this 4a is so cute and just tiny. Still too hard on my eyes even though I've adjusted it.* Problems with contact resizing comment area on YouTube underneath the video. What is that?!* Difficult to learn the touch system. I'm still messing up over a month after getting this. Hard to minimize, hard to pull things back up. It doesn't do what you want it to do.* Big problem at the bottom of the screen with the swipe bar white line and corner elements showing up on the top of everything. I hate it and so does everyone else. You'd have to root the phone to get rid of that. I've reported this to Google. That little bar interferes with the buttons of some apps and you can't proceed (Continue) in some apps I've needed.Other than that, this has been my second favorite phone. My fave was a Moto G I had - it was the perfect phone for me but died a year later. So sad. This is why I chose Pixel because these phones last long, and in that way I think a good value for your money.\",\n",

Note the time displayed when the phone is idle in the photo.  Also, when the phone wakes up, you go directly to your home screen.  No more wake swipe-swipe to get to something.Cons: gesture navigation is a mixed bag.  I like having more screen real estate, but the back swipe interferes with in-app navigation.  Bluetooth still seems to be a mess, you still can't easily put a shortcut to connect to just one specific device.Other: For me, the battery can last two days with light use, with typical use I'm maybe down to 33% at the end of the day.\",\n",

I don't worry about drops because it's polycarbonate, and I disliked glass backs ever since the LG V30. The Pixel 4a is simple, it's clean, it works, and it runs the latest Android.

You just connect the old phone and the new one with a cable, switch over the SIM card, and start the transfer. It installs the phone with the new SIM card, no waiting at Verizon to do it and then paying them for the non-service. It transfers contacts, photos, and other content. All the apps are setup for transfer, but it waits until you have WiFi to start the process. Non-sensitive ones came over with passwords transferred, too. Sensitive ones, like bank card, mobile banking, and other security-sensitive apps required you to sign on again. Swiping instead of 3 buttons at the bottom of the screen finally had the best of me, but there is an option to install the traditional 3-button controls, and it works like a charm.

       " \"--UPDATE AFTER TALKING WITH GOOGLE SUPPORT---NEVER buy a Google Pixel phone if you plan to travel, work or live outside the US. It's way too common with mobile phones that there can be problems with the screen or a battery, either from manufacturer error or user error or because mobile phone batteries have a limited lifespan. Google Pixels are way too rarely used worldwide, so outside the US they are difficult or impossible to be repaired. Talking with Google Support, the only option is to pay myself to mail it back to the US, with mail time and repair time that would take at least 4-6 weeks. During which point I'd need to buy another phone to use in the meantime; or, at all times you have to purchase TWO Google Pixel phones in the event that you have a problem with one because they're too difficult to have repaired most anywhere outside the US, so that's a problem if you work, live or travel outside the US. If you plan to live or travel outside the US. Buy a Samsung or Apple instead.---UPDATE 6 MONTHS LATER ---The phone was a nice phone, but the battery stopped charging after 6 months. I didn't drop in water, it's not damaged, but it stopped charging so then it's worthless. I followed all of the troubleshooting steps but it still won't work. Another problem is I live and work overseas, so it's not feasible to send this to a Google official repair place (none nearby), that would require 4-6 weeks at least. I went to a local phone repair tech near me, they said the USB port looks fine but it won't charge. Now to even get a replacement battery, that will take 3-4 weeks.Tip for those who travel: Don't use the Google Pixel. It's a decent phone, but if there's a problem, it's so hard to repair. Google Pixel's aren't used widely enough worldwide to be able to repair them anywhere. For that, a Samsung or Apple phone would be better. If your battery goes bad (which happens in phones) or you crack your screen (also a common occurrence) and you live or travel a lot, these are very troublesome and even impossible to get serviced or repaired.--- ORIGINAL REVIEW ---Good quality build and functions for a mid-range phone. The Pixel 4a is a little smaller overall than the 3a. The screen is about the same, but it extends to the full edge of the phone to achieve a similar screen size. But to do this, the corners of the screen are completely rounded, which I don't prefer as much, and the front camera lens is inside the screen, which hasn't been that big of a deal. The only problem so far is the phone froze during an incoming call and couldn't be answered, phone had to be restarted. Battery life seems ok, but have to purposefully limit what the phone automatically accesses to limit use and extend battery.\",\n",
       " \"Pixel 4a has such potential to be a great phone given all it's attributes but there is one issue that drags it down in the rankings: build quality.I should have heeded the warnings in many reviews but was drawn in by all this lower price phone can offer. It really is a workhorse that can keep up with the big boys until it's Achilles heel is exposed....build quality.I purchased a Crave protective case when I bought the phone. It was on the phone right after the 4a was unboxed and never removed. On the 5th day of ownership it slipped out of my hand, falling less than 3 feet to the ground (driveway). I picked up the phone, placed my finger on the reader and was shocked to see that the impact had cracked the screen! In all my years of cellphone ownership and many phone drops, this was the first screen break.I was shocked, disappointed and angry.Buyer beware: the reviews are true that while it is a great little phone it is FRAGILE and VERY BREAKABLE!!!\",\n",

(I don\\'t understand the need for the wide angle lens on other new models of the Pixel.)I could take a \"real camera\" with me, but I have found in recent years that when I do, I still use the phone for most shots.The Pixel 4a does not have the latest engine, but it is still much faster and smoother than my old one.It doesn\\'t have the largest battery, but for normal use battery life has been far better than on my old phone.One great feature of this phone was the easy transfer of files and apps from the old Pixel.I highly recommend this phone.',\n",

The best thing about the phone is android 11, I am upgrading from one plus 2 with lollipop and the different in os is huge. But it runs so smooth. Apps open and work flawlessly and everything is very quick and responsive for a 350  dollar phone. The only con for me is the screen size , more specifically the width. It took a bit of adjusting from my oneplus 2 which was wider and easier to type on. I make way more typos with this to the point is use the voice typing now more than touch (which wasn't available on lollipop). Overall I am very pleased with this phone, for the money I can see myself using this until the android updates stop.

There is a supposed sound amplifier app built in, but doesn't seem to do anything. The screen is great, color is very deep, and vibrant.

Finally, she came back and said she could only offer me a refund (now Amazon was out of stock of Black as well).  While I thought about it, couldn\\'t have been more than 15-30 seconds, she demanded an answer out of me!  I told her she needed to show me the same patience I had shown her in waiting for her response! Rude!  Any who I\\'ve decided to keep the phone since I mostly use it just as a phone anyway but am very disappointed in both Google and Amazon on this one.',\n",

I bought the pixel 4a started using it right away I haven't picked up iphone since I got the pixel. I absolutely love it!!!! I have gone from team iphone to team pixel and I'm pretty sure this is going to be my main daily driver phone. I love everything about it. (I did just order the pixel 5) so anyone who is thinking about going from iphone to pixel DO IT!!!! The camera is amazing. The battery life is great.

       " 'I\\'m coming from a samsung android note 9. Loved my note 9 but turns out I\\'m not that good with big bulky all glass expensive phones... Who woulda thought🤔 ... My whole back of my note 9 phone was shattered and the screen was cracked and I had an otterbox on it the entire time I had the thing. Long story short I bought the phone out after 2 years to switch services and when I went to switch they took my case off to switch sim cards and it was a shattered mess which I was highly disappointed about because I thought it was in good shape!. I could have gotten it fixed for around $400 or I could get a different phone. I didn\\'t want nothing hella expensive I\\'m tired of having to pay extra for phone payments and then just breaking them because obviously I\\'m just not good with phones! I wanted something budget friendly with a good quality camera but still similar to androids system. I\\'ve been team android forever now I just really don\\'t care for their picture quality though, I have tried iphone out as well I had the iphone x and it just wasn\\'t for me, however I did love the picture quality, so since I\\'ve tried both ios and android and have certain things I like and disliked for both of them I figured it was time to give pixels a try!Pros:This phone is cute, little, and light weight phone, but like not so little that the screens no good. The screen to phone ratio is super nice and makes the phone feel smaller with a good sized screen. Which is what I wanted  I was over having huge, heavy bulky phones, I have little hands and I constantly was dropping my bigger phones...Picture quality is awesome! It def beats android and I think it might even beat iphones!Easy set up with transferring from my old phone to this one.The backs plastic! Which that was what I was looking for! People complain that \"oh its so boring looking with the plain black plastic back\"... I don\\'t get it, so youd rather have a pretty glass back that you end up covering with a bulky case... Cause that makes so much sense...I like how you can either have the navigation buttons or you can use the swipe controls. I like this so your not stuck with one or the other.battery lifes pretty good the charge seems to last me as long as my note 9 did.It def seems very durable. I do have a screen protector along with a case on this phone, not even a good case or screen protector just something cheap I grabbed. I\\'ve dropped the phone a few times now and no have had no issues!Volume is also pretty goodCons:My biggest pet peeves with this phone isssss I hate the way screen shots are on this phone! Okay so the power button and the volume down button is how you take screen shots, which is normal for screen shots but on this phone the volume buttons and the power button are on the same side which makes it awkward to do and then sometimes when doing it the volume bar will pop up and turn everything all the way down and the bar just stays there which is annoying....I don\\'t like how there\\'s not as much customization as androids would have, such as changing the themes and stuff which sorta disappoints me.Conclusion:All in all, the pixel 4a really is not a bad budget phone for people like me that are just to rough for these high end all glass, thousand dollar phones... I would eventually like to get one of the nicer pixels this one was mostly to try it out and see if I even like them before getting one of the more expensive ones later down the road. Nice thing about pixels even there higher end phones such as the pixel 5 arent robbing you like some of these dang androids and iphones are!If your looking for a nice budget phone you won\\'t go wrong getting this one. Would recommend!',\n",

It does come with a cable for data transfer. The data transfer is for the phone settings, contacts, text messages and anything not on the cloud. I use google photos, so those are in the cloud already for example. There were some photos that were only on my phone and not on the cloud and those got transferred as well.Other nice features:+Android's 11 new interface is very sleek and love it.+The phone is very responsive. Octo processor.+Audio quality is very good. Not loud enough, but is way better than its predecessor.

I used 120HZ refresh rate all the time, but quite honestly I don't see a great difference between them.Honestly, I would really hope this phone to have a bigger screen.

       " 'Hello Reader,First of all, I would like to clarify one thing, I bought Google Pixel 4a for one reason and one reason only, which is:To flash and try GrapheneOS and CalyxOS on Google Pixel 4aSo, If you are looking for any Android phone, please think twice before buying Google Pixel 4a.I placed the order on \"Feb 4th 2021\", and I received it on \"Feb 7th 2021\", I live in Bahrain and the phone sold by\"Triplenet Pricing INC\" in USA, That was really impressive to get the phone in just two days.Pros:1- Very good speaker sound, for a small phone.2- good screen resolution and touch.3- good reception for carrier signal.4- Only Google Apps installed by default.5- ironically, Google Pixel devices meet the stringent privacy and security standards, that is why it\\'s supported by GraphenOS and CalyxOSCons:1- I consider it expensive for its HW specs, there are other good brands in the market with higher specs with same or less price with really good feel and touch and good chassis, for example: OnePlus 7.2- the phone edges have air pockets, you feel it and hear sound when you softly press on the edges, the body is polycarbonate unibody, what do you expect.3- Forget to use the phone without an armor case and screen protector, you will lose it very quickly if you did not. Conclusion:If you are just looking for an android phone and you do not care about the brand, think twice before you buy Google Pixel 4a, you can find a better phone with same or lees price.Buy Google Pixel 4a only if you really want to, and you have your own reasons to do that, as I do.',\n",
       " \"Fine phone for the money.  There is a program that comes with this phone called YouTube Music.  I opened it to see if it would play my mp3's. At once it was obvious this was a music streaming service so I closed it. Next I was informed I had started a free trial period for You Tube Music. The fine print informed me that in a few weeks the free trial would roll over into a paid monthly subscription unless I cancelled before the trial period ended. I have spent days trying to cancel this, there is NO WAY to cancel a You Tube Music trial membership before the rollover. This is wrong, illegal, and basically theft of that first month's subscription payment. Any corporate entity that was not as huge as this one would be concerned about being involved in such a blatant rip-off. If 5 million people buy this phone and open this app, and don't want the membership.... that's still a lot of lawyer money.\",\n",

I both cases I had to restart the phone manually since even the restart on the screen was frozen. Hope it's just a software issue that can be fixed when google pushes out a newer software version. The rest is fine. I was previously using Huawei smart phone it's a slightly better phone than a pixile for almost the same price, changed because Huawei is no longer supported by many American companies including android and hoogle, so some apps stopped working.

No overlayed brand bloat software, no brand promoted  apps you can't get rid of, no third party branded internet browser you can't uninstall ,and the pure Android runs really smooth and fast.You can add Firefox,Opera,or any browser you wish. Fits well in one hand for single-handed use while still fitting in a pocket.There's probably nothing better in the price range if you need CDMA and GSM ability in one phone.I transferred all settings,contacts ,messages and phone number with the provided cable and was able to use my old sim with no issues. No hassle.I don't understand why this is often compared to flagship phones in the $600 up range -it's not.Google makes others beside the Pixel 4a  if you need 5G or some trendy features.If you are upgrading from a cheaper,outdated OS LG,Samsung,Motorola phone this is a clear winner.Two or three times the ram and most likely double the storage  of your old phone.It does have a plastic back,but it's very sturdy without flex and better made than my LG and previous Samsung that will never offer system updates.. The Pixel 4a came with Android 10 and has already updated to 11.Display is good , even in sunlight where cheap phones may not be.The speakers do not rival $800 phones, but they are very good sounding  compared to  $100-250 phones;much better than the rear firing speakers I was used too. Bluetooth and wireless signal and sound quality are strong as well,with better speed on wireless..The  single lens camera is great for low light and sharp images in .raw or standard .jpeg like most folks use - far superior color, sharpness, and exposure than other phones also rated at 12 MP- but note that you can't adjust the shutter speed or f stop like a S20FE or S10 - but I really don't need three lenses ,I have a dslr for that.There's an 8mp front camera that performs  well too.There's no SD card slot,and I initially thought that was a minus since I use a 64GB SD for music.But I don't have any problems with the  128GB. You can swap or copy files to/from a PC or tablet with a 3.0 USBA to usb C cable like any phone; perhaps slower depending on your PC or tablet USB ratings.\",\n",

The memory/storage is more than sufficient, so I can do way more than my last phone allowed before slowing down due to low memory. Also, I wanted it smaller so it wouldn't weigh as much as the 'phablets' that everyone else likes, fits better for my hands & how I use it. If I want to watch a movie, i would rather cast it from my phone to a smart tv anyway, so it's perfect for everyday life. Fingerprint scanning works seamlessly & I haven't used face recognition yet.  I use my phone for everything, like most of us these days, so it runs constantly & battery life is very good  taking that into consideration. Charges very fast as well. I also like all the little extras it offers, like digital wellbeing that tracks the time u spend online, etc. It's convenient & interesting to know. Just to be clear, I chose this model due to the excellent camera specs, high memory capacity & the size. Everything else is just an added bonus of having a reliable midgrade phone made by Google. I have had many Samsung's in the past & I love them, but ones I looked at were too expensive for what I need & want.\",\n",

If I open the camera it starts recording the second it opens & will jump back to recording, while taking photos. I find it very frustrating to use. Pictures aren't as good as I had hoped.

       " 'Phone for personal  use. Absolutely not user friendly, compared to LG phone I had previously. This is a \"typical\" Google \"nerd\" phone that is designed for techies, not for \"normal\" older users. Camera is great I guess--use it about once every month--I have cameras.  Battery  and charging are excellent. Non-standard USB cord provided--need to buy others for car,etc.  Big problem has been phone never rings, or when it does, it impossible to \"swipe\" to open. Bad notifications (none) Never know when messages or voice mail is received--have to manually check.  Google continually send automatic notices and pop-ups to sell more products--can\\'t turn off. When you turn off one function, it will normally turn OFF others, e.g., sound, so you never get notices of calls.  Biggest advantage is that it is a smaller phone, 5+ by 2+ inches, easier to carry  than the nerd 7\" X 3\" monsters.  I bought it partly for blue-tooth connectivity, which is OK. My LG was 100% more user friendly.I had bought the Apple LS, but it died within a week, so I went back to Android--Big Mistake. Now have to eat $500 to change, LG does not make the small phone anymore.  No one does it seems. My phone hone is used primarily for calls.

And the Pixel-specific features are outstanding.  Even though the camera isn\\'t the top-tier hardware we\\'d expect from flagships, Google\\'s computational photography is unrivaled.

No surprise, it\\'s not as good as the iPhone 11.  But again, for the money, it\\'s really good.

The body and screen are decent, however, the speaker quality is so dismal I am considering to selling it. 4a is at least a decent(ish) value for money and the camera punches above its weight. I initially got Pixel 5 but had to sell it because it had very much the same issues except it cost $650. The whole experience of 4a is very imbalanced. I miss the audio quality and materials of my Samsung Galaxy S7 every minute and that is a five year old phone. The drop in quality is shocking.If you use the phone as a phone, something designers at Goggle probably don't, you'll want to hurl it through the window soon. It is practically unusable as a speaker phone which is something the competition does usually very well. The loudspeaker accentuates any minor issues participants may have with their lines: the one that is a tad too bassy buzzes and sounds hollow, faint lines sound fainter etc. Samsung figured this out years back!Similarly, you will almost never be able to set the loudness level correctly between ringtones, alarms, media volumes between loudspeaker use and headphone use. Imagine you set your ringtone so that you can hear it in normal use. Then you switch to headphones to play a song. Then someone calls you. Your eardrums will almost explode because the phone is too dumb to adjust for headphones!Perhaps I am too focussed on the audio quality. But for me it is a key function. There is a lot of hype about Google products but substance is simply not there. Google sells you cheap iron designed by a team who really do not know how to make it work together. And a good camera.

Screen scratched very easily. Battery life is pretty unremarkable, I get about a day of use with it. Screen is actually smaller than my last phone.

Granted some of them are gimmicks, but you'll be able to impress your friends with a 350USD phone.The camera is probably the pixel 4as biggest selling point. The funny thing is it isn't really the camera itself that makes it good. It's all the software that allows 1 camera to emulate the functions of a lot of 4-camera phones.

Sometimes it doesn't ring when I get a call..I purchased it from the Google store and they refused to replace it, claiming I didn't buy it directly from Google.  The only way to contact Google is through email and you get one email a day from them, which solves nothing. They have chat, but at least half the time it isn't available and when it is, there is a very long wait.

I have large hands and still feel like this footprint is perfect-Very capable and efficient 730G chipset (less than 20% slower than the 765G on Pixel 5)Cons-No wide angle or telephoto lens (personally would have loved to see a 3x 12MP lens perhaps?)-No wireless charging or water resistance (though with a C - to - C cable you'd probably still be able to charge your buds)Overall, this phone get's my highest recommendation.

We are on the Verizon prepaid plan and pay $60 a month total, for both phones ($30 each!!). We have never had an issue with data usage with our plan and this phone can handle it all.

Has a good camera, though I really should snap more pictures and videos with it. front facing camera is great for video calls. Of all of the phones that I have used this is the best in that category.Cons: the UI has a learning curve to it. so take the tutorial. Though this is a new feature with the current Android OS, there is no back button. Yeah I know. I miss it too. there is no slot for a micro SD card. Not a problem if you use the cloud to back them up, but I don't always go were I have a data connection, plus I like to move my videos between devices. And the front facing camera feels off. I personally like the centered punch out cameras on the LG and Samsung phones that I have used.Overall. this is a good value. Even with the arrival of 5G network on the horizon. I recommend this as it fits in the palm of my hand. Has a well matched processor and ram configuration and has 128GB of storage. which should be enough for most users. the front facing camera works really well on video calls even in low light. And the WiFi radio has a good to great range, depending on frequency used.\",\n",

Even though it's only maybe 1cm smaller than other phones it really fits in the hand much better. The plain Android software works well, and it gets regular software updates. Other than that it's much the same as any other Android phone.Battery life is pretty good, not as good as phones with larger batteries but you do have to compromise a little when you choose a small phone - there's not much space for the battery in there. I charge my battery to 80% and most days with light use it's at about 40 - 50% at the end of the day. If I use it really heavily it would probably still last the day but it'd be pretty low so I tend to do a top-up charge. The supplied charger tops the phone up really quickly, which heats the phone up a little more than I'd like so I tend to use a medium speed charger most of the time, but it's great if I'm in a hurry.\",\n",

The device would not display anything so when you connect it to your new phone or even a PC to grab data, you can't enable the access (again, no screen).  So the standard workaround is plug a USC-C to HDMI cable in and use your TV to access the UI to allow access; except GOOGLE disables this!  So you have no option other than costly screen repair to recover data.Sure, if you enable backup at least you have your last backup in the google cloud, but my work policy won't allow that.

This phone was advertised as having an all day battery and I\\'m sure it is true for heavy users.

Google being the creator of both is likely what makes this phone better than its (overpriced) competitors. I haven\\'t had the phone for quite a month yet, so I\\'ll update this review if I need to. Here\\'s where a more \"budget\" phone surprisingly stands out:1) The speaker has more clarity versus that of the Note10+.2) The fingerprint reader on the back has a much higher success rate than the Note10+\\'s (in regards to accuracy). It is also easier to physically use.3) Google kindly allows for the bootloader to be unlocked. So if you are feeling bold, you can load on a custom ROM. (Who knows? Maybe that would help you learn to love coding; it did for me.)4) Insane battery life. I charge it every other night. And this isn\\'t with light use; I\\'d say the same might be true for you.5) The ergonomics of the phone make it easy on the hand to hold. It rarely falls out of my hand, unlike the Note10+.It really should get a star off for not being water-resistant, and another half-star off for not supporting wireless charging. But it\\'s just such a well-performing machine that I refuse to subtract anything from my rating.TL;DR - This is the closest Android you can get to what makes an iPhone so special, which is the hardware and software being tightly integrated from the factory.',\n",
       " \"I bought this on a whim after using various Galaxy phones since 2013.  Being very adjusted to that version of Android OS that Galaxy uses, it's weird at first to see Google's take on an Android OS but after only about an hour or two, it's pretty convenient in this phone.  My least favorite part about getting a new phone is transferring all my previous data to a new device, but Android to Android makes this process so streamlined, I had all my music, photos, apps, wallpapers, and smaller settings in about 15 minutes from when I first booted the phone up.  A few things I think that makes this device stand out is that it's like an iPhone XS with an Android OS running it.  The display is clear and sharp, the touch is consistent, the camera is superb for the price that you pay, and the software is rather simple and clean to use.  If you're concerned about the punch-out camera in the top left of the screen like I was, don't worry.  It's barely noticeable when using the device like normal.  This phone's size is pretty comfortable when it comes to one handed use. The matte finish on the back side gives the device a nice feel when it's being used.  So far, I really like my Pixel 4a and I'm happy I jumped ship.  If you're someone who wants a phone for more basic tasks while being streamlined, then pick this up and give it a go, you won't be disappointed.\",\n",
       " \"Phone works great as a smart phone. No complaints there. However, the charging port stopped working after 1 year and I sent it in for repair under warranty. The repair isn't covered and says its due to water damage. My phone has not been in any water. The only thing I can think of is that I am sometimes walking in the rain and my phone is in my pocket. If walking with the phone in the rain is not supported, then this phone is not worth buying! The warranty won't help you, apparently. And there's no way to contest the verdict! Not happy.\",\n",
       " \"I had the Pixel 4a for a month in late 2020, and I generally liked the phone. The most important part that makes this phone great is the price, $350. It's not going to get you any top-tier iPhone 12 Pro Max or Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, but it gives you everything the general user would possibly need - a decently fast Snapdragon 730G SOC, 6GB RAM, and 128GB storage. That's something that not even the $830 base configuration of iPhone 12 gets you.Of course, being $350 there are a few things that it misses out on compared to higher-tier phones. One of those things would be the plastic unibody build over something like a metal and glass sandwich. On a phone of this price point it's fine, though I did have a bit of plastic creaking near the SIM slot. It was just an annoyance at worst, because the rest of the plastic build felt fine.Wireless charging is also not present, this may disappoint some that used it but it didn't bother me cause I never used wireless charging on my iPhone 8.There's no water resistance either, which did raise my eyebrows a bit before I bought the phone but I don't submerge my phone in water or take it to very dusty places.One thing this does have that the $700 Pixel 5 doesn't have is a headphone jack. So if you still use anything with a 3.5mm plug, this phone has you covered with no need for adapters! The speakers are also quite good, with one speaker on the bottom next to the USB-C port and one built into the earpiece.As for the software, it's got three years of updates which is better than many Android manufactures, but it still won't top Apple's software support. I did notice a few software bugs when I used it, mainly with YouTube Vanced's PIP mode after a certain amount of time. Restarting fixed the issue but it was an annoyance. Hopefully that was just Android 11 and that gets fixed with a future update.Battery life is also pretty decent, better than the aging battery on my iPhone 8 since I could comfortably leave it off the charger for one night. Given that it's a small phone by today's standards it's not going to be a battery life king, but it's better than the $400 iPhone SE.The size is something I loved about this phone, my hands are relatively small and I like my phone to be pocketable, which is something that I'm not a fan of with most new phones being over 6 inches in size. The 5.81-inch edge-to-edge screen Is of a similar size to my iPhone 8 and the iPhone X, thus I could easily use it with one hand and it fit well in my pockets. This is something I'm sure is greatly appreciated by those who also like smaller phones.The camera has been the definition of the Pixel phones since the first ones launched in 2016. This phone has an amazing single 12MP lens, mostly made great by Google's computational photography software. Night mode was very nice to use, as in the scenarios I used it in it helped out take better photos at night. I'm no expert with cameras so I don't know much about white balance, dynamic range, etc. I do like how this phone gives you one great camera as opposed to other manufacturers which give you like seven different pretty-much-useless camera sensors.Overall, this is the phone to buy if you're on a budget of less than $500 and you want something that will fulfill all the general needs. I would suggest going for the Pixel 4a 5G version if you can afford a $500 phone as that has a second ultrawide camera lens, a faster Snapdragon 765G SOC, and as the name says, 5G connectivity. That phone will overall will give you a very very close experience to the Pixel 5, but if you don't have that much to put down for a phone, and if you like the standard 4a's smaller size, this phone is the way to go. I highly recommend it and I would personally pick this any day of the week over a similarly priced phone from a China brand like Oppo, Xiaomi, ZTE, Vivo, etc.\",\n",
       " \"I owned the first Android phone, the TMobile G1, and I've owned the Google Nexus phone, but I never owned a Pixel.  Earlier phones left a lot to be desired, but not this one.  I kind of wanted a Pixel phone but they were always a little outside my budget.  After waiting awhile I finally decided to buy a Pixel 4a.  Everything, the size, screen, performance (no lag), call and speaker quality, bluetooth and WiFi connectivity, 3.5 mm jack, battery life, and of course the camera are all outstanding.  I'm extremely happy with this.  I also bought the Crave case and OMOTON screen protectors.  I look forward to a couple years of good service until I upgrade to the next version.  If you need a great Android phone stop sitting on the fence.  This is it.\",\n",

All the features you need, without all the extra stuff you will never use anyway. I have had the phone several days, and only charged it twice...

It is distracting how fuzzy it looks. I'm shocked that none of the reviews that I read prior to buying the phone mentions this. I did a quick search and tons of people have had this issue. The camera itself is fine and clear when taking photos so this leads me to think it's a software issue. I tried video calls using the built in calling app, Duo, Google Hangouts, Signal, Jitsi, and Line, all were the same blurry mess. The only app where video call was clear for me was Facebook Messenger.  Guidance by support is to clean camera lens and factory reset the phone...the brand new phone I got a few days ago. Now I'm in situation where I'm determining if I should return and buy another phone or stick to pixel 4a and put up with video calls that looks like I'm using a digital camera from 10 years ago.\",\n",

Well they said it would cost to much to fix so I got a certified used phone in return at no extra cost. Well I am still having the same sound issue with the new phone. the AUX port doesn't work.

       " \"After just a couple months of use, the side power button stopped working. Now, five months into use, the side volume buttons do not work either. I am very very disappointing that I bought this phone.Update: almost a year since I bought it and I had to trade it in for a different phone. The side buttons continued to not work with increasing regularity. I had to ensure that the phone never died, because I could not turn it back on if it did. It recently died on a backpacking trip, and I couldn't get it to turn on when I really needed it to find EV charging stations. It was extremely frustrating and I finally traded it in while completely fed up. The non-functional side buttons also caused me to regularly pocket-dial people since I couldn't turn the screen off. The phone also heated up super easily.I'm bummed that the phone did not work out. The camera really is amazing, the battery life out-stripped an iphone by far, and the amount of storage that is just built into the base model is awesome. If google improves the body of the phone and its functionality, I'd consider trying out a pixel again.\",\n",

I really like the nice compact size, the absence of bloatware, nice looking photos, fast response and great display.  The battery lasts one or two days depending on your settings and usage of course and it charges very quickly.  Android upgrades should arrive more quickly as well since it's a Google product.  I certainly recommend this phone and I am very happy with the purchase.\",\n",

In addition, Google gives unlimited back up to its Pixel phones.Battery life is solid.  I charge nightly and while I drive... but it wouldn't matter.  Compared to my previous Moto, this thing sips power.It has 6 gig of ram, which means it will stay speedy for a couple years.  There is no external memory... but the 128 gig onboard is plenty.I bought mine unlocked (it will work with pretty much any carrier) and I use it on the Hello Mobile network (they piggyback T-Mobile).  It helps to be a bit of a geek to get set up on Hello Mobile (all online, no stores) but once set up it is the cheapest out there.  I get 4 lines of unlimited everything for 70 bucks a month.\",\n",

My old OnePlus can still go all day with plenty of screen time and still have 30% left by the time I go to bed, and I routinely used to get almost 2 days out of it back when the phone was new.But the Pixel 4a struggles to make it to the end of one full day even with brightness set much dimmer than the OnePlus.I would consider the 4a to be the absolute bare minimum battery life acceptable for a smartphone. I'm not commuting much anymore, but this feels like a phone that would have me stressing about making my commute home without an emergency battery pack.It's acceptable, but certainly not great.\",\n",

       " \"The phone was great for a few months then it started having issues with the screen.  The top part of the screen would not allow me to press it so that it would move to a different screen on an app or anything that was in that vacinity. I called google for help, they wanted me to take the phone to the closest repair location, 135 miles away in San Antonio, TX.  I could not take it right away, it took me 3 weeks to finally take the phone to their location Youbreakitwefixit.  Well by the time I took it, I had an accident with my phone and the screen was damaged.  Well when I took it in, I explained to them that the screen had issues before the screen was damaged.  I admitted that I damaged the screen, try convincing them that the issue was before the damage.  No chance, they said they could not mess with it and that the charge for my screen change was $150.  I was 135 miles away, no choice but to change it, trying to get intouch with google is impossible.  So they changed the screen, I paid what I had to, guess what 3 days later the screen got a green cloud started on top part of the phone.  I told the Youbreakitwefix manager to take a look at it, he saw it and said that they would replace it, I would have to leave it.  I could not, I had to come back to my hometown, 135 miles away.  I told him I would return the next day, drive another 135 miles, I could not because of my work.  I came back 5 days later and my phone was dead, the screen black.  So I called and asked if the phone was still covered and if I could return it to get fixed based on me having the manager look it over and seeing that it was nothing I had done.  They said yes to bring it, I get there they look over the phone and they say it had a hair line crack, small one at the corner.  I told them I had not seen anything and the employee had reviewed it and nothing was broken.  But I knew I was going to lose because I had returned 5 days later and they would assume I damaged it.  Anyway I called the regional manager pled my case and got 50% off the next change of screen.  Well again I had paid already over $225 for two screen changes in week.  I get back to home town and use it for 2 weeks buying the best screen protector and phone case.  Well guess what again the issue happens the green cloud forms on the phone, top part.  I can't believe it!!!  So I contact the Youbreakitwefixit regional manager, I try contacting Google again all to a frustrating no success.  So a local phone repair shop said it sounds like there is something that is left on that edge of the phone underneath, a glass a piece of something and when the screen is put on and I use it or leave it my pocket even with the screen protector and cover it damages the screen.  He saw my  phone it had no damage to the screen none to the body, nothing.  He said he could replace it for $180 including labor.  This is too much of a headache.!!!!  Do not deal with Google, and buy the protection when you purchase this phone!!!\",\n",

But there are some disadvantages with this phone. First: Video calls, I use facebook messenger a lot for video calls, this phone gets extremely hot during video calls and cant even handle it for an hour. No Miracast protocol which means you cannot cast/screen mirror your phone to Roku/Smart TVs without their stupid device chromecast. Google disabled this feature for business purposes to sell chromecast, even though you can still hack your phone to do this, does not worth it. Otherwise this phone is good, charges fast, runs great, fingerprint great, great colors and display, good camera, I am giving 4 star to this phone because they made \"Apple move\" by disabling my favorite feature on this phone.

The only thing I find annoying is in the software not the hardware, I'd like to be able to disable right-edge back-swipe, for certain apps.  But you can reduce the detection area.

Night mode is absolutely amazing. Takes amazing pictures, sharp and color accurate. Video recording is great as well. The only downside can be considered the fact that sometimes when you take a pictures it takes like 2-3 second to process it, but other than that it is really really good, like one of the best.Many people say that the holepunch camera cutout is annoying, but it is in a such a spot that it disappears in use, even during watching videos and movies. I almost never notice it while watching content or browsing, unless I absolutely have to see an info that is written on that corner.Battery, the probably the only downside of this phone, you might be like why? well because it is inconsistent, it can last you with the same exact use on most days for like 6 and even 7 hours! but on others it might last 3 or 4, I don't understand why is the battery like this, from what I have researched in background it runs some kind of android system process that bottlenecks it from time to time. But overall I would rate it 4 stars, would have been 5 if it was not like this.Fingerprint scanned is, well really really fast, almost instant, but like other fingerprint scanners, if your fingers are wet it wont recognize them, but its like this on like 90% of others phones which I have used with this feature so It doesn't really bother me.Build quality is good, I don't mind the plastic back because it feels really good in your hand, its smooth and not slippery, it is really nice to hold it in hand, but as most other users I have a case on it.Other google features really make this phone a good experience, for example the music recognition and others.Overall this phone is a solid 4.7 out of 5, as I said the battery can be a mix bag but other than that it is great. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who wants a good phone, which has some good features, amazing camera, good battery life on most days, nice screen, good performance and solid, nice feel in the hand.

It's an actual pleasure to use, everytime.The camera is adequate. Pretty disappointing, actually. I loved the first Pixel for its image quality, and this one is identical. Literally. They did improve the computational processing, but... eh, four years later and I really expected better. The sensor is quite dated. BUT, it does its job, and slightly better than the first iteration, so, I am not too deposed over it.Overall, love this thing. Although, it IS a budget phone. Do consider that. However, if you are looking for an exemplary version of a hudget phone, with good software (brought to you by our Google overlords), then this is a great option.\",\n",
       " 'Just got back from the local Verizon store and they confirmed the phone is not configured to work on their LTE Advanced network.  It will make out going calls but will not receive incoming calls and text messages take up to 5 minutes to be received.',\n",
       " \"I bought it a while ago to use mainly as a phone/PDA. The interface on the phone is very minimalistic and smooth. The aspect ratio on the screen is a bit odd and takes some getting used to, but due to the narrowness of the phone, it actually fits perfectly in my hand (with case), and pocket too... The feel on the phone itself is a bit on the slippery side, so just get a rubber case and you'll be fine(everyone uses that anyways). The phone has a lot of automated functions built directly into the phone, so you don't need a ton of third party apps to do basic things. The only core function 3rd party apps that i currently use are:-Soft screenlocking (i'm not a huge fan of button pressing)-fingerprint gesture (so i can lock and unlock with just a finger on the sensor)-document scanner (this should be built directly into camera apps today, but you know...)I like that the home button has been built into a soft one (like i said i'm not a huge fan of button pressing)The swipe keyboard is very quick and gets the right words.The only problem i've encountered in the 7 months of usage is that you have to keep the light sensor cleaned, because the adaptive brightness will occasionaly make the screen unusable in sunlight, then you have to get to a shade to manually turn up the brightness. But this isn't directly a manufacturing flaw, just something that you need to keep in mind\",\n",
       " \"I had a galaxy A 50 thought I'd give Google a shot I like how since Google already runs everything it automatically fills everything out but I may go back to a galaxy maybe a pixel 6 one speaker doesn't work and it was missing the charging block\",\n",
       " \"This phone was the best there is, until I upgrade to Android 12 in 2022. After the upgrade, the phone's battery life only lasts 5-6 hours and heats really bad. This was not the case in android 11. I submitted a ticket to Google support and they were unable to provide a fix. Waited for 2 months to no avail. You can go check the community forums in Google Pixel and see I am not the only one. Shame this happened. No excuse since its the software developer who made this phone. So, no more Pixel phones for me, moving to another brand.\",\n",
       " 'I have loved this phone, for just over a year. And 3 months after the warranty expired I got errors one day that debris or liquid was dected in the charging port. There was no liquid. But it stopped charging. UbreakIfix fixed the charging port but then it wouldn\\'t read a SIM card. They said the liquid sensor had been tripped and they couldn\\'t fix it. So I sent it to Google and they said it also had \"liquid damage\" even though there was no water near my phone. It started having the error with the charging port when I had it in my pocket. But none the less it is more expensive to replace the phone than to fix it. How can the \"liquid damage\" sensor get tripped when there isn\\'t any liquid?',\n",
       " \"I want to love this phone but I'm so disappointed. I convinced my daughter to buy the same one and my husband was about to get the newest model but just realized that all the corners of the phone are chipping. The phone has been on a case since day 1 and it looks horrible. I looked it up and found hundreds of other reviews with the same issue. Horrible flaw and i wouldn't buy another pixel.\",\n",
       " \"I purchased the phone based on online reviews by pundits and users. The camera was rated great - check, all day battery life - check, great screen - check, Android without the bloatware - check. Everything was great except it didn't fit my big hands. It felt awkward and too small for me to hold until I received the phone case I ordered later than the phone purchase. Adding the phone case made holding the phone acceptable, however, there was still one thing I missed that I had on my last phone and that is a larger screen. I'm 60 and now need to use reading glasses so a larger screen on my aging eyes is a definite must for me.If you have smaller hands and don't mind a small screen this is a great device. And if you have big hands then it may not fit for you. My suggestion is to go to the store and hold a Pixel a4 or a phone the same size to see if it feels okay in your hand. If it fits then you can't go wrong with this phone.With that said I am sad to say that I returned it for a Samsung A71 which has a much larger screen and is rated great also.\",\n",
       " \"It's really really good. Now that I've had for half a year I can say that is an excellent phone. Oled screen(that equals good), perfect size even for my big hands, and the camera is super nice. My problems with it is that after some time the battery starts to run dry really fast, at the begining it lasted the hole day, now I barely get 6-7 hours out of it. Also the speakers are starting to get a bit distorted. But for the 350$ that I paid, it is an outstanding package.\",\n",
       " 'THE PHONE IS HORRIBLE TO USE AND FEATURES DO NOT ALWAYS OPERATE. SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO TAP ON THE SPOT  MANY TIMES TO GET IT TO REACT.  WHEN TYPING A TEXT IT MOVES OFF SITE MANY TIMES DURING TYPING AND YOU HAVE TO GO ON A SEARCH FOR IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.  IT RELENTLESSLY PUSHES GOOGLE CONTENT. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND AGAINST PURCHASING THIS PHONE. IT IS REALLY NOT A GOOD PRODUCT AND I AM IMMEDIATELY LOOKING FOR ANOTHER PHONE AND HOPEFULLY RETURN THIS ONE.',\n",
       " \"So far this phone has been okay (the first 4a was defective from the start), but now it is having problems after less than a year. The current issues is the mic (sporadically people cannot hear me at all  - as if on on mute, not poor reception). Tried every recommended troubleshooting technique (and the thing has a strong case and has not been dropped) so probably hardware failure.  Small chance its android 12 interaction but so far this doesn't seem to be aligned with known issues.I do not have a lot of extra apps (though the Pixels are bloated with google stuff to start)  so i was surprised the battery life is not really great - maybe 14 hours if you do not use it for anything other than talk/text.Compact size is good but be mindful of case options - phone is susceptible to moisture and it is difficult to find a waterproof case that doesn't cause muffled sound and buzzing (though clearly after a year that would be the least of your mic problems).\"]"
